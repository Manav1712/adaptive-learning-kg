- Accuracy
  - Edges reflect real relationships (few wrong links).
  - Content truly supports its linked LO.
- Directionality and structure
  - Prerequisite edges point the right way.
  - No cycles in LO→LO prerequisites (forms a sensible order).
- Coverage
  - Most important LOs have at least one incoming prerequisite.
  - Most content items are linked to at least one relevant LO.
- Coherence of learning paths
  - Sequences of LOs feel pedagogically natural and progressive.
  - No sudden jumps in difficulty without prerequisites.
- Consistency with curriculum
  - Links generally respect unit/chapter organization.
  - Cross-unit links exist only when clearly justified.
- Parsimony (signal over noise)
  - Minimal redundant or low-value edges.
  - Avoid overly dense clusters that don’t add clarity.
- Interpretability
  - Clear labels, rationales, and tooltips explain why edges exist.
  - Easy to understand node types and relationship meanings.
- Stability
  - Results are consistent across reruns (small variance).
  - Small data changes don’t wildly change the graph.
- Utility
  - Helps retrieve the right content for a given LO.
  - Supports building reasonable study plans and diagnostics.
- Multimodal benefit
  - Image information adds value where present (not just noise).
