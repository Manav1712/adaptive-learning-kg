Figure 1: International passports and travel documents

In espionage movies, we see international spies with multiple passports, each claiming a different identity. However, we know that each of those passports represents the same person. The trigonometric identities act in a similar manner to multiple passports—there are many ways to represent the same trigonometric expression. Just as a spy will choose an Italian passport when traveling to Italy, we choose the identity that applies to the given scenario when solving a trigonometric equation.

In this section, we will begin an examination of the fundamental trigonometric identities, including how we can verify them and how we can use them to simplify trigonometric expressions.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/1e54300a6b3e77521ff564a1a049ea86d3536fa0""]",Precalculus 2e,Solving Trigonometric Equations with Identities,Solving Trigonometric Equations with Identities,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
958_concept_1,concept,958,"# Verifying the Fundamental Trigonometric Identities 

Identities enable us to simplify complicated expressions. They are the basic tools of trigonometry used in solving trigonometric equations, just as factoring, finding common denominators, and using special formulas are the basic tools of solving algebraic equations. In fact, we use algebraic techniques constantly to simplify trigonometric expressions. Basic properties and formulas of algebra, such as the difference of squares formula and the perfect squares formula, will simplify the work involved with trigonometric expressions and equations. We already know that all of the trigonometric functions are related because they all are defined in terms of the unit circle. Consequently, any trigonometric identity can be written in many ways.

To verify the trigonometric identities, we usually start with the more complicated side of the equation and essentially rewrite the expression until it has been transformed into the same expression as the other side of the equation. Sometimes we have to factor expressions, expand expressions, find common denominators, or use other algebraic strategies to obtain the desired result. In this first section, we will work with the fundamental identities: the Pythagorean Identities, the even-odd identities, the reciprocal identities, and the quotient identities.

We will begin with the Pythagorean Identities (see Table 1), which are equations involving trigonometric functions based on the properties of a right triangle. We have already seen and used the first of these identifies, but now we will also use additional identities.

| Pythagorean Identities | | |
|  - |  - | - |
| \[\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1\] | \[1 + \cot^2\theta = \csc^2\theta\] | \[1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta\] |

Table 1

The second and third identities can be obtained by manipulating the first. The identity \[1 + \cot^2θ = \csc^2θ\] is found by rewriting the left side of the equation in terms of sine and cosine.

Prove: \[1 + \cot^2θ = \csc^2θ\]

\[
\begin{align*}
1 + \cot^2\theta & = \left(1 + \frac{\cos^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta}\right) && \text{Rewrite the left side.} \\
& = \left(\frac{\sin^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta}\right) + \left(\frac{\cos^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta}\right) && \text{Write both terms with the common denominator.} \\
& = \frac{\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta} && \\
& = \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta} && \\
& = \csc^2\theta &&
\end{align*}
  
\]

Similarly, \[1 + \tan^2 θ = \sec^2 θ\] can be obtained by rewriting the left side of this identity in terms of sine and cosine. This gives

\[
\begin{align*}
1 + \tan^2\theta & = 1 + \left(\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}\right)^2 && \text{Rewrite left side.} \\
& = \left(\frac{\cos\theta}{\cos\theta}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}\right)^2 && \text{Write both terms with the common denominator.} \\
& = \frac{\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta}{\cos^2\theta} && \\
& = \frac{1}{\cos^2\theta} && \\
& = \sec^2\theta &&
\end{align*}

\]

The next set of fundamental identities is the set of even-odd identities. The even-odd identities relate the value of a trigonometric function at a given angle to the value of the function at the opposite angle and determine whether the identity is odd or even. (See Table 2).

|Even-Odd Identities | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \[\tan(-\theta) = -\tan \theta\]  | \[\sin(-\theta) = -\sin \theta\] | \[\cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta\] |
| \[\cot(-\theta) = -\cot \theta\] |  \[\csc(-\theta) = -\csc \theta\] | \[\sec(-\theta) = \sec \theta\]

Table 2

Recall that an odd function is one in which \[f(-x) = -f(x)\] for all \[x\] in the domain of \[f.\] The sine function is an odd function because \[\sin(-\theta) = -\sin \theta.\] The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin. For example, consider corresponding inputs of \[\frac{\pi}{2}\] and \[-\frac{\pi}{2}.\] The output of \[\sin(\frac{\pi}{2})\] is opposite the output of \[\sin(-\frac{\pi}{2}).\] Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= 1 \\
\text{and} \\
\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\
&= -1
\end{align*}
\]

This is shown in Figure 2.



Figure 2: Graph of \[y = \sin \theta\]

Recall that an even function is one in which

\[f(-x) = f(x) \text{ for all } x \text{ in the domain of } f\]

The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis. The cosine function is an even function because \[\cos(-θ) = \cos θ.\]
For example, consider corresponding inputs \[π/4\] and \[-π/4.\] The output of \[\cos(\frac{π}{4})\] is the same as the output of \[\cos(-\frac{π}{4}).\] Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}) &= \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) \\
&\approx 0.707
\end{align*}
\]

See Figure 3.



Figure 3: Graph of \[y = \cos \theta\]

For all \[\theta\] in the domain of the sine and cosine functions, respectively, we can state the following:

- Since \[\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta\], sine is an odd function.
- Since, \[\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta\], cosine is an even function.

The other even-odd identities follow from the even and odd nature of the sine and cosine functions. For example, consider the tangent identity, \[\tan(-\theta) = -\tan \theta.\] We can interpret the tangent of a negative angle as \[\tan(-\theta) = \frac{\sin(-\theta)}{\cos(-\theta)} = \frac{-\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = -\tan \theta.\] Tangent is therefore an odd function, which means that \[\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)\] for all \[\theta\] in the domain of the tangent function.

The cotangent identity, \[\cot(-θ) = -\cot θ,\] also follows from the sine and cosine identities. We can interpret the cotangent of a negative angle as \[\cot(-θ) = \frac{\cos(-θ)}{\sin(-θ)} = \frac{\cos θ}{-\sin θ} = -\cot θ.\] Cotangent is therefore an odd function, which means that \[\cot(-θ) = -\cot(θ)\] for all \[θ\] in the domain of the cotangent function.

The cosecant function is the reciprocal of the sine function, which means that the cosecant of a negative angle will be interpreted as \[\csc(-θ) = \frac{1}{\sin(-θ)} = \frac{1}{-\sin θ} = -\csc θ.\] The cosecant function is therefore odd.

Finally, the secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function, and the secant of a negative angle is interpreted as \[\sec(-θ) = \frac{1}{\cos(-θ)} = \frac{1}{\cos θ} = \sec θ.\] The secant function is therefore even.

To sum up, only two of the trigonometric functions, cosine and secant, are even. The other four functions are odd, verifying the even-odd identities.

The next set of fundamental identities is the set of reciprocal identities, which, as their name implies, relate trigonometric functions that are reciprocals of each other. See Table 3.

Reciprocal Identities ||
| --- | --- |
| \[\sin\theta = \frac{1}{\csc\theta}\] | \[\csc\theta = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\] |
| \[\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sec\theta}\] | \[\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}\] |
| \[\tan\theta = \frac{1}{\cot\theta}\] | \[\cot\theta = \frac{1}{\tan\theta}\] |

Table 3

The final set of identities is the set of quotient identities, which define relationships among certain trigonometric functions and can be very helpful in verifying other identities. See Table 4.

Quotient Identities ||
| --- | --- |
| \[\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\] | \[\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}\] |

Table 4

The reciprocal and quotient identities are derived from the definitions of the basic trigonometric functions.

## Summarizing Trigonometric Identities

The Pythagorean Identities are based on the properties of a right triangle.

\[\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1\]

\[1 + \cot^2\theta = \csc^2\theta\]

\[1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta\]

The even-odd identities relate the value of a trigonometric function at a given angle to the value of the function at the opposite angle.

\[\tan(-\theta) = -\tan\theta\]

\[\cot(-\theta) = -\cot\theta\]

\[\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta\]

\[\csc(-\theta) = -\csc\theta\]

\[\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta\]

\[\sec(-\theta) = \sec\theta\]

The reciprocal identities define reciprocals of the trigonometric functions.

\[\sin\theta = \frac{1}{\csc\theta}\]

\[\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sec\theta}\]

\[\tan\theta = \frac{1}{\cot\theta}\]

\[\csc\theta = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\]

\[\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}\]

\[\cot\theta = \frac{1}{\tan\theta}\]

The quotient identities define the relationship among the trigonometric functions.

\[\tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}\]

\[\cot\theta = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\]

# Example 1

## Graphing the Equations of an Identity

Graph both sides of the identity \[\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\]. In other words, on the graphing calculator, graph \[y = \cot \theta\] and \[y = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\].

# Solution:

See Figure 4.



Figure 4

## Analysis

We see only one graph because both expressions generate the same image. One is on top of the other. This is a good way to confirm an identity verified with analytical means. If both expressions give the same graph, then they are most likely identities.

## HOW TO

Given a trigonometric identity, verify that it is true.

1. Work on one side of the equation. It is usually better to start with the more complex side, as it is easier to simplify than to build.
2. Look for opportunities to factor expressions, square a binomial, or add fractions.
3. Noting which functions are in the final expression, look for opportunities to use the identities and make the proper substitutions.
4. If these steps do not yield the desired result, try converting all terms to sines and cosines.

# Example 2

## Verifying a Trigonometric Identity

Verify \[\tan \theta \cos \theta = \sin \theta .\]

# Solution:

We will start on the left side, as it is the more complicated side:

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta \cos \theta &= \left( \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \right) \cos \theta \\
&= \left( \frac{\sin \theta}{\cancel{\cos \theta}} \right) \cancel{\cos \theta} \\
&= \sin \theta
\end{align*}
\]

## Analysis
This identity was fairly simple to verify, as it only required writing \(\tan \theta\) in terms of \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta.\)

# Example 3

## Verifying the Equivalency Using the Even-Odd Identities

Verify the following equivalency using the even-odd identities:

\[(1 + \sin x)[1 + \sin(-x)] = \cos^2 x\]

# Solution:

Working on the left side of the equation, we have 

\[
\begin{align*}
(1 + \sin x)(1 + \sin(-x)) & = (1 + \sin x)(1 - \sin x) && \text{Since } \sin(-x) = -\sin x \\
& = 1 - \sin^2 x && \text{Difference of squares} \\
& = \cos^2 x && \text{Since } \cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x
\end{align*}
  
\]

# Example 4

Verifying a Trigonometric Identity Involving 
 \[\sec^2θ\]

Verify the identity \[\frac{{\sec^2θ - 1}}{{\sec^2θ}} = \sin^2θ\]

# Solution:

As the left side is more complicated, let’s begin there.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{{\sec^2\theta - 1}}{{\sec^2\theta}} & = \frac{{(\tan^2\theta + 1) - 1}}{{\sec^2\theta}} &&&&&& \sec^2\theta = \tan^2\theta + 1 \\
& = \frac{{\tan^2\theta}}{{\sec^2\theta}} \\
& = \tan^2\theta \left(\frac{1}{{\sec^2\theta}}\right) \\
& = \tan^2\theta (\cos^2\theta) &&&&&& \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{\sec^2\theta} \\
& =  \left(\frac{{\sin^2\theta}}{{\cos^2\theta}}\right)(\cos^2\theta) &&&&&& \tan^2\theta= \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos^2\theta} \\
& = \left(\frac{{\sin^2\theta}}{\cancel{\cos^2\theta}} \right) \cancel{(\cos^2\theta)} \\
& = \sin^2\theta
\end{align*}

\]

There is more than one way to verify an identity. Here is another possibility. Again, we can start with the left side.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{{\sec^2\theta - 1}}{{\sec^2\theta}} & = \frac{{\sec^2\theta}}{{\sec^2\theta}} - \frac{1}{{\sec^2\theta}} \\
& = 1 - \cos^2\theta \\
& = \sin^2\theta
\end{align*}

\]

## Analysis

In the first method, we used the identity \(\sec^2θ = \tan^2θ + 1\) and continued to simplify. In the second method, we split the fraction, putting both terms in the numerator over the common denominator. This problem illustrates that there are multiple ways we can verify an identity. Employing some creativity can sometimes simplify a procedure. As long as the substitutions are correct, the answer will be the same.

# Example 5

## Creating and Verifying an Identity

Create an identity for the expression \[2 \tan \theta \sec \theta\] by rewriting strictly in terms of sine.

# Solution:

There are a number of ways to begin, but here we will use the quotient and reciprocal identities to rewrite the expression:

\[
\begin{align*}
2 \tan \theta \sec \theta & = 2 \left( \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\cos \theta} \right) \\
& = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} \\
& = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{1 - \sin^2 \theta} \quad \text{Substitute } 1 - \sin^2 \theta \text{ for } \cos^2 \theta
\end{align*}
  
\]

Thus,

\[2 \tan \theta \sec \theta = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{1 - \sin^2 \theta}\]

# Example 6

## Verifying an Identity Using Algebra and Even/Odd Identities

Verify the identity:
\[
\frac{{\sin^2(-θ) - \cos^2(-θ)}}{{\sin(-θ) - \cos(-θ)}} = \cosθ - \sinθ
\]

# Solution:

Let’s start with the left side and simplify:

\[
\frac{{\sin^2(-\theta) - \cos^2(-\theta)}}{{\sin(-\theta) - \cos(-\theta)}} = \frac{{[\sin(-\theta)]^2 - [\cos(-\theta)]^2}}{{\sin(-\theta) - \cos(-\theta)}}
\]

\[
= \frac{{(-\sin\theta)^2 - (\cos\theta)^2}}{{-\sin\theta - \cos\theta}} \quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \sin(-x) = -\sin x \ \  \text{and} \ \cos(-x) = \cos x
\]

 

\[
= \frac{{(\sin\theta)^2 - (\cos\theta)^2}}{{-\sin\theta - \cos\theta}} \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{Difference of squares}
\]

\[

\]

\[
= \frac{{(\sin\theta - \cos\theta)(\sin\theta + \cos\theta)}}{{-(\sin\theta + \cos\theta)}}
\]

\[
= \frac{{(\sin\theta - \cos\theta)(\cancel{\sin\theta + \cos\theta})}}{{-\cancel{(\sin\theta + \cos\theta)}}}
\]

\[
= \cos\theta - \sin\theta
\]

# Example 7

## Verifying an Identity Involving Cosines and Cotangents 

Verify the identity: \[(1 - \cos^2x)(1 + \cot^2x) = 1.\]

# Solution:

We will work on the left side of the equation.

\[
 \begin{align*}
(1 - \cos^2x)(1 + \cot^2x) & = (1 - \cos^2x)\left(1 + \frac{\cos^2x}{\sin^2x}\right) \\
& = (1 - \cos^2x)\left(\frac{\sin^2x}{\sin^2x} + \frac{\cos^2x}{\sin^2x}\right) \quad \text{Find the common denominator.} \\
& = (1 - \cos^2x)\left(\frac{\sin^2x + \cos^2x}{\sin^2x}\right) \\
& = (\sin^2x)\left(\frac{1}{\sin^2x}\right) \\
& = 1
\end{align*}

959_concept_1,concept,959,"# Using Algebra to Simplify Trigonometric Expressions

We have seen that algebra is very important in verifying trigonometric identities, but it is just as critical in simplifying trigonometric expressions before solving. Being familiar with the basic properties and formulas of algebra, such as the difference of squares formula, the perfect square formula, or substitution, will simplify the work involved with trigonometric expressions and equations.

For example, the equation \[(\sin x + 1)(\sin x - 1) = 0\] resembles the equation \[(x + 1)(x - 1) = 0,\] which uses the factored form of the difference of squares. Using algebra makes finding a solution straightforward and familiar. We can set each factor equal to zero and solve. This is one example of recognizing algebraic patterns in trigonometric expressions or equations.

Another example is the difference of squares formula, \[a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\], which is widely used in many areas other than mathematics, such as engineering, architecture, and physics. We can also create our own identities by continually expanding an expression and making the appropriate substitutions. Using algebraic properties and formulas makes many trigonometric equations easier to understand and solve.

# Example 8

## Writing the Trigonometric Expression as an Algebraic Expression

Write the following trigonometric expression as an algebraic expression: \[2\cos^2θ + \cosθ - 1.\]

# Solution:

Notice that the pattern displayed has the same form as a standard quadratic expression, \[a x^2 + b x + c.\] Letting \[\cos \theta = x,\] we can rewrite the expression as follows:

\[2 x^2 + x - 1\]

This expression can be factored as \[(2x - 1)(x + 1).\] If it were set equal to zero and we wanted to solve the equation, we would use the zero factor property and solve each factor for \[x.\] At this point, we would replace \[x\] with \[\cos \theta\] and solve for \[\theta.\]

# Example 9

## Rewriting a Trigonometric Expression Using the Difference of Squares 

Rewrite the trigonometric expression: \[4 \cos^2 θ - 1.\]

# Solution:

Notice that both the coefficient and the trigonometric expression in the first term are squared, and the square of the number 1 is 1. This is the difference of squares. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
4 \cos^2 θ - 1 &= (2 \cos θ)^2 - 1 \\
&= (2 \cos θ - 1)(2 \cos θ + 1)
\end{align*}
\]

## Analysis

If this expression were written in the form of an equation set equal to zero, we could solve each factor using the zero factor property. We could also use substitution like we did in the previous problem and let \(\cos θ = x\), rewrite the expression as \(4x^2 - 1\), and factor \((2x - 1)(2x + 1)\). Then replace \(x\) with \(cos θ\) and solve for the angle.

# Example 10

## Simplify by Rewriting and Using Substitution
Simplify the expression by rewriting and using identities:
\[\text{csc}^2 \theta - \text{cot}^2 \theta\]

# Solution:

We can start with the Pythagorean identity.

\[
1 + \cot^2θ = \csc^2θ
\]

Now we can simplify by substituting \(1 + \cot^2θ\) for \(\csc^2θ\). We have

\[
\begin{align*}
\csc^2θ - \cot^2θ &= 1 + \cot^2θ - \cot^2θ \\
&= 1

How can the height of a mountain be measured? What about the distance from Earth to the sun? Like many seemingly impossible problems, we rely on mathematical formulas to find the answers. The trigonometric identities, commonly used in mathematical proofs, have had real-world applications for centuries, including their use in calculating long distances.

The trigonometric identities we will examine in this section can be traced to a Persian astronomer who lived around 950 AD, but the ancient Greeks discovered these same formulas much earlier and stated them in terms of chords. These are special equations or postulates, true for all values input to the equations, and with innumerable applications.

In this section, we will learn techniques that will enable us to solve problems such as the ones presented above. The formulas that follow will simplify many trigonometric expressions and equations. Keep in mind that, throughout this section, the term *formula* is used synonymously with the word *identity*.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/606b76141b8299543ee768f57ef10ea3f5d64439""]",Precalculus 2e,Sum and Difference Identities,Sum and Difference Identities,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
961_concept_1,concept,961,"# Using the Sum and Difference Formulas for Cosine

Finding the exact value of the sine, cosine, or tangent of an angle is often easier if we can rewrite the given angle in terms of two angles that have known trigonometric values. We can use the special angles, which we can review in the unit circle shown in Figure 2.



Figure 2: The Unit Circle

We will begin with the sum and difference formulas for cosine, so that we can find the cosine of a given angle if we can break it up into the sum or difference of two of the special angles. See Table 1.

| Sum formula for cosine | Difference formula for cosine |
| --- | --- |
| \[\cos(α + β) =\cosα \cosβ - \sinα \sinβ\] | \[\cos(α - β) = \cosα \cosβ + \sinα \sinβ\] |

Table 1

First, we will prove the difference formula for cosines. Let’s consider two points on the unit circle. See Figure 3. Point \(P\) is at an angle \(\alpha\) from the positive x-axis with coordinates \((\cos\ \alpha, \sin\ \alpha)\) and point \(Q\) is at an angle of \(\beta\) from the positive x-axis with coordinates \((\cos\ \beta, \sin\ \beta)\). Note the measure of angle \(POQ\) is \(\alpha - \beta\).

Label two more points: \(A\) at an angle of \((α−β)\) from the positive x-axis with coordinates \((\cos(α−β), \sin(α−β));\) and point \(B\) with coordinates \((1,0)\). Triangle \(POQ\) is a rotation of triangle \(AOB\) and thus the distance from \(P\) to \(Q\) is the same as the distance from \(A\) to \(B\).



Figure 3

We can find the distance from \[P\] to \[Q\] using the distance formula.

\[
\begin{align*}
d_{PQ} &= \sqrt{(\cos\alpha - \cos\beta)^2 + (\sin\alpha - \sin\beta)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{\cos^2\alpha - 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta + \cos^2\beta + \sin^2\alpha - 2\sin\alpha\sin\beta + \sin^2\beta}
\end{align*}

\]

Then we apply the Pythagorean Identity and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
&= \sqrt{(\cos^2\alpha + \sin^2\alpha) + (\cos^2\beta + \sin^2\beta) - 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta - 2\sin\alpha\sin\beta} \\
&= \sqrt{1 + 1 - 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta - 2\sin\alpha\sin\beta} \\
&= \sqrt{2 - 2\cos\alpha\cos\beta - 2\sin\alpha\sin\beta}
\end{align*}

\]

Similarly, using the distance formula we can find the distance from \[A\] to \[B.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
d_{AB} &= \sqrt{(\cos(α−β)−1)^2 + (\sin(α−β)−0)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{\cos^2(α−β)−2\cos(α−β)+1+\sin^2(α−β)}
\end{align*}
\]

Applying the Pythagorean Identity and simplifying we get:

\[
\begin{align*}
&= \sqrt{(\cos^2(α−β) + \sin^2(α−β)) - 2\cos(α−β) + 1} \\
&= \sqrt{1 - 2\cos(α−β) + 1} \\
&= \sqrt{2 - 2\cos(α−β)}
\end{align*}
\]

Because the two distances are the same, we set them equal to each other and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{2 - 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta - 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta} &= \sqrt{2 - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta)} \\
2 - 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta - 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta &= 2 - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta)
\end{align*}
\]

Finally we subtract \[2\] from both sides and divide both sides by \[-2.\]

\[\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta = \cos(\alpha - \beta)\]

Thus, we have the difference formula for cosine. We can use similar methods to derive the cosine of the sum of two angles.

## Sum and Difference Formulas for Cosine

These formulas can be used to calculate the cosine of sums and differences of angles.

\[\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta\]

\[\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta\]

## HOW TO

Given two angles, find the cosine of the difference between the angles.

1. Write the difference formula for cosine.
2. Substitute the values of the given angles into the formula.
3. Simplify.

# Example 1

## Finding the Exact Value Using the Formula for the Cosine of the Difference of Two Angles

Using the formula for the cosine of the difference of two angles, find the exact value of \[\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{6}\right).\]

# Solution:

Use the formula for the cosine of the difference of two angles. We have

\[

The sum and difference formulas for sine can be derived in the same manner as those for cosine, and they resemble the cosine formulas.

## Sum and Difference Formulas for Sine

These formulas can be used to calculate the sines of sums and differences of angles.

\[\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin\alpha \cos\beta + \cos\alpha \sin\beta\]

\[\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin\alpha \cos\beta - \cos\alpha \sin\beta\]


## HOW TO

Given two angles, find the sine of the difference between the angles.

1. Write the difference formula for sine.
2. Substitute the given angles into the formula.
3. Simplify.

# Example 3

## Using Sum and Difference Identities to Evaluate the Difference of Angles

Use the sum and difference identities to evaluate the difference of the angles and show that part \[a\] equals part \[b\].

ⓐ \[\sin(45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ})\]
ⓑ \[\sin(135^{\circ} - 120^{\circ})\]

# Solution:

ⓐ Let’s begin by writing the formula and substitute the given angles.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\alpha - \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
\sin(45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ}) &= \sin(45^{\circ}) \cos(30^{\circ}) - \cos(45^{\circ}) \sin(30^{\circ})
\end{align*}
\]

Next, we need to find the values of the trigonometric expressions.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(45^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \
\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \
\cos(45^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \
\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the equation and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ}) &= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}
\end{align*}
\]

ⓑ Again, we write the formula and substitute the given angles.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\alpha - \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
\sin(135^{\circ} - 120^{\circ}) &= \sin(135^{\circ}) \cos(120^{\circ}) - \cos(135^{\circ}) \sin(120^{\circ})
\end{align*}
\]

Next, we find the values of the trigonometric expressions.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(135^{\circ}) &= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\
\cos(120^{\circ}) &= -\frac{1}{2}, \\
\cos(135^{\circ}) &= -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\
\sin(120^{\circ}) &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{align*}
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the equation and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(135^{\circ} - 120^{\circ}) &= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{-\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{4} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 4

## Finding the Exact Value of an Expression Involving an Inverse Trigonometric Function

Find the exact value of \[\sin(\cos^{-1}\frac{1}{2} + \sin^{-1}\frac{3}{5}).\]

# Solution:

The pattern displayed in this problem is \[\sin(\alpha + \beta).\] Let \[\alpha = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\] and \[\beta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right).\] Then we can write

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \alpha &= \frac{1}{2}, & 0 &\leq \alpha \leq \pi \\
\sin \beta &= \frac{3}{5}, & -\frac{\pi}{2} &\leq \beta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}
\end{align*}
  
\]

We will use the Pythagorean Identities to find \[\sin \alpha\] and \[\cos \beta.\]

\[
  \begin{align*}
\sin \alpha &= \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \alpha} \\
&= \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\cos \beta &= \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} \\
&= \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{25}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} \\
&= \frac{4}{5}
\end{align*}

\]

Using the sum formula for sine,

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\cos^{-1}\frac{1}{2} + \sin^{-1}\frac{3}{5}) &= \sin(\alpha + \beta) \\
&= \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{3} + 3}{10}

963_concept_1,concept,963,"# Using the Sum and Difference Formulas for Tangent

Finding exact values for the tangent of the sum or difference of two angles is a little more complicated, but again, it is a matter of recognizing the pattern.

Finding the sum of two angles formula for tangent involves taking quotient of the sum formulas for sine and cosine and simplifying. Recall, \[\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}, \cos x ≠ 0.\]

Let’s derive the sum formula for tangent.

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan(\alpha + \beta) &= \frac{\sin(\alpha + \beta)}{\cos(\alpha + \beta)} \\
&= \frac{\sin\alpha \cos\beta + \cos\alpha \sin\beta}{\cos\alpha \cos\beta - \sin\alpha \sin\beta} \\
&= \frac{\frac{\sin\alpha \cos\beta + \cos\alpha \sin\beta}{\cos\alpha \cos\beta}}{\frac{\cos\alpha \cos\beta - \sin\alpha \sin\beta}{\cos\alpha \cos\beta}} \quad \text{Divide the numerator and denominator by } \cos\alpha \cos\beta \\
&= \frac{\frac{\sin\alpha \cancel{\cos\beta}}{\cos\alpha \cancel{\cos\beta}}+\frac{\cancel{\cos\alpha} \sin\beta}{\cancel {\cos\alpha} \cos\beta}}{\frac{\cancel{\cos\alpha} \cancel{\cos\beta}}{\cancel{\cos\alpha} \cancel{\cos\beta}}-\frac{\sin\alpha \sin\beta}{\cos\alpha \cos\beta}} 
\\
&= \frac{\frac{\sin\alpha}{\cos\alpha} + \frac{\sin\beta}{\cos\beta}}{1 - \frac{\sin\alpha \sin\beta}{\cos\alpha \cos\beta}} \\
&= \frac{\tan\alpha + \tan\beta}{1 - \tan\alpha \tan\beta}
\end{align*}
\]

We can derive the difference formula for tangent in a similar way.

## Sum and Difference Formulas for Tangent

The sum and difference formulas for tangent are:

\[\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta}\]

\[\tan(\alpha - \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta}\]

## HOW TO

Given two angles, find the tangent of the sum of the angles.

1. Write the sum formula for tangent.
2. Substitute the given angles into the formula.
3. Simplify.

# Example 5

## Finding the Exact Value of an Expression Involving Tangent

Find the exact value of \[\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right).\]

# Solution:

Let’s first write the sum formula for tangent and substitute the given angles into the formula.

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan(\alpha + \beta) &= \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta} \\
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) &= \frac{\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) + \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{1 - \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}
\end{align*}
\]

Next, we determine the individual tangents within the formula:

\[
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1
\]

So we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) &= \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + 1}{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(1)} \\
&= \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} \\
&= \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 6

## Finding Multiple Sums and Differences of Angles

Given \[\sin \alpha = \frac{3}{5}, 0 < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2}, \cos \beta = -\frac{5}{13}, \pi < \beta < \frac{3\pi}{2}\], find

ⓐ \[\sin(\alpha + \beta)\]
ⓑ \[\cos(\alpha + \beta)\]
ⓒ \[\tan(\alpha + \beta)\]
ⓓ \[\tan(\alpha - \beta)\]

# Solution:

We can use the sum and difference formulas to identify the sum or difference of angles when the ratio of sine, cosine, or tangent is provided for each of the individual angles. To do so, we construct what is called a reference triangle to help find each component of the sum and difference formulas.

ⓐ
   To find \[\sin(\alpha + \beta),\] we begin with \[\sin \alpha = \frac{3}{5}\] and \[0 < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2}.\] The side opposite \[\alpha\] has length 3, the hypotenuse has length 5, and \[\alpha\] is in the first quadrant. See Figure 4. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of side
   \[a: a^2 + 3^2 = 5^2, a^2 = 16, a = 4.\]

   

   Figure 4

   Since \[\cos \beta = -\frac{5}{13}\] and \[\pi < \beta < \frac{3\pi}{2},\] the side adjacent to \[\beta\] is -5, the hypotenuse is 13, and \[\beta\] is in the third quadrant. See Figure 5. Again, using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have
   \[(-5)^2 + a^2 = 13^2, 25 + a^2 = 169, a^2 = 144, a = ±12.\]

   Since \[\beta\] is in the third quadrant, \[a = –12.\]

   

   Figure 5

   The next step is finding the cosine of \[\alpha\] and the sine of \[\beta.\] The cosine of \[\alpha\] is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. We can find it from the triangle in Figure 5: \[\cos \alpha = \frac{4}{5}.\] We can also find the sine of \[\beta\] from the triangle in Figure 5, as opposite side over the hypotenuse: \[\sin \beta = -\frac{12}{13}.\] Now we are ready to evaluate \[\sin(\alpha + \beta).\]

   \[\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = (\frac{3}{5})(-\frac{5}{13}) + (\frac{4}{5})(-\frac{12}{13}) = -\frac{15}{65} - \frac{48}{65} = -\frac{63}{65}.\]

ⓑ
   We can find \[\cos(\alpha + \beta)\] in a similar manner. We substitute the values according to the formula.
   \[\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = (\frac{4}{5})(-\frac{5}{13}) - (\frac{3}{5})(-\frac{12}{13}) = -\frac{20}{65} + \frac{36}{65} = \frac{16}{65}.\]

ⓒ
   For \[\tan(\alpha + \beta),\] if \[\sin \alpha = \frac{3}{5}\] and \[\cos \alpha = \frac{4}{5},\] then
   \[\tan \alpha = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{3}{4}.\]

   If \[\sin \beta = -\frac{12}{13}\] and \[\cos \beta = -\frac{5}{13},\] then
   \[\tan \beta = \frac{-\frac{12}{13}}{-\frac{5}{13}} = \frac{12}{5}.\]

   Then,
   \[\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta} = \frac{\frac{3}{4} + \frac{12}{5}}{1 - \frac{3}{4}(\frac{12}{5})} = \frac{-\frac{33}{20}}{\frac{56}{20}} = -\frac{33}{56}.\]

ⓓ
   To find \[\tan(\alpha - \beta),\] we have the values we need. We can substitute them in and evaluate.
   \[\tan(\alpha - \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha - \tan \beta}{1 + \tan \alpha \tan \beta} = \frac{\frac{3}{4} - \frac{12}{5}}{1 + \frac{3}{4}(\frac{12}{5})} = \frac{-\frac{33}{20}}{\frac{56}{20}} = -\frac{33}{56}.\]

## Analysis

A common mistake when addressing problems such as this one is that we may be tempted to think that \[\alpha\] and \[\beta\] are angles in the same triangle, which of course, they are not. Also note that \[\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\sin(\alpha + \beta)}{\cos(\alpha + \beta)}.\]","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/e4a8ffb2028de3341686bf527a941318fc5f6a20"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/2a629dbce0f2d75f5cdf594690e5a71e85e1f7cd""]",Precalculus 2e,Using the Sum and Difference Formulas for Tangent,Sum and Difference Identities,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
964_concept_1,concept,964,"# Using Sum and Difference Formulas for Cofunctions

Now that we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent functions for the sums and differences of angles, we can use them to do the same for their cofunctions. You may recall from Right Triangle Trigonometry that, if the sum of two positive angles is \[\frac{\pi}{2},\] those two angles are complements, and the sum of the two acute angles in a right triangle is \[\frac{\pi}{2},\] so they are also complements. In Figure 6, notice that if one of the acute angles is labeled as \[\theta,\] then the other acute angle must be labeled \[\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right).\]

Notice also that \[\sin \theta = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right)\] opposite over hypotenuse. Thus, when two angles are complementary, we can say that the sine of \[\theta\] equals the cofunction of the complement of \[\theta.\] Similarly, tangent and cotangent are cofunctions, and secant and cosecant are cofunctions.



Figure 6

From these relationships, the cofunction identities are formed.

## Cofunction Identities

The cofunction identities are summarized in Table 2.

| | |
|---|---|
| \[\sin\theta = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\] | \[\cos\theta = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\] |
| \[\tan\theta = \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\] | \[\cot\theta = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\] |
| \[\sec\theta = \csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\] | \[\csc\theta = \sec\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\] |

Table 2

Notice that the formulas in the table may also be justified algebraically using the sum and difference formulas. For example, using

\[
\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta,
\]

we can write

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) &= \cos\frac{\pi}{2}\cos\theta + \sin\frac{\pi}{2}\sin\theta \\
&= (0)\cos\theta + (1)\sin\theta \\
&= \sin\theta
\end{align*}
\]

## Finding a Cofunction with the Same Value as the Given Expression

Write \[\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{9}\right)\] in terms of its cofunction.

# Solution:

The cofunction of \[\tan \theta = \cot(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta)\] Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{9}\right) &= \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{9}\right) \\

Verifying an identity means demonstrating that the equation holds for all values of the variable. It helps to be very familiar with the identities or to have a list of them accessible while working the problems. Reviewing the general rules from Solving Trigonometric Equations with Identities may help simplify the process of verifying an identity.

## HOW TO

Given an identity, verify using sum and difference formulas.

1. Begin with the expression on the side of the equal sign that appears most complex. Rewrite that expression until it matches the other side of the equal sign. Occasionally, we might have to alter both sides, but working on only one side is the most efficient.
2. Look for opportunities to use the sum and difference formulas.
3. Rewrite sums or differences of quotients as single quotients.
4. If the process becomes cumbersome, rewrite the expression in terms of sines and cosines.

# Example 8

## Verifying an Identity Involving Sine

Verify the identity \[\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta) = 2 \sin \alpha \cos \beta.\]

# Solution:

We see that the left side of the equation includes the sines of the sum and the difference of angles.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\alpha + \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
\sin(\alpha - \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\end{align*}
\]

We can rewrite each using the sum and difference formulas.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta + \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
&= 2 \sin \alpha \cos \beta
\end{align*}
\]

We see that the identity is verified.

# Example 9

## Verifying an Identity Involving Tangent
Verify the following identity.

\[\frac{\sin(α−β)}{\cos α \cos β} = \tan α - \tan β\]

# Solution:

We can begin by rewriting the numerator on the left side of the equation.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin(\alpha - \beta)}{\cos \alpha \cos \beta} &= \frac{\sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta}{\cos \alpha \cos \beta} \\
&= \frac{\sin \alpha \cancel{\cos \beta}}{\cos \alpha \cancel{\cos \beta}} - \frac{\cancel{\cos \alpha} \sin \beta}{\cancel{\cos \alpha} \cos \beta}  \quad \text{Rewrite using a common denominator.}\\
&= \frac{\sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha} - \frac{\sin \beta}{\cos \beta} \quad \text{Cancel.}\\
&= \tan \alpha - \tan \beta \quad \text{Rewrite in terms of tangent. }
\end{align*}
  
\]

We see that the identity is verified. In many cases, verifying tangent identities can successfully be accomplished by writing the tangent in terms of sine and cosine.

# Example 10

## Using Sum and Difference Formulas to Solve an Application Problem

Let \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) denote two non-vertical intersecting lines, and let \(\theta\) denote the acute angle between \(L_1\) and \(L_2\). See Figure 7. Show that

\[
\tan\theta = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1 m_2}

where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the slopes of \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) respectively. (Hint: Use the fact that \(\tan\theta_1 = m_1\) and \(\tan\theta_2 = m_2\). )



Figure 7

# Solution:

Using the difference formula for tangent, this problem does not seem as daunting as it might.

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan\theta &= \tan(\theta_1 - \theta_2) \\
&= \frac{\tan\theta_1 - \tan\theta_2}{1 + \tan\theta_1\tan\theta_2} \\
&= \frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1m_2}

\]

# Example 11

## Investigating a Guy-wire Problem

For a climbing wall, a guy-wire \[R\] is attached 47 feet high on a vertical pole. Added support is provided by another guy-wire \[S\] attached 40 feet above ground on the same pole. If the wires are attached to the ground 50 feet from the pole, find the angle \[α\] between the wires. See Figure 8



Figure 8

# Solution:

Let’s first summarize the information we can gather from the diagram. As only the sides adjacent to the right angle are known, we can use the tangent function. Notice that \[\tan \beta = \frac{47}{50},\] and \[\tan(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{40}{50} = \frac{4}{5}.\] We can then use difference formula for tangent.

\[\tan(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{\tan \beta - \tan \alpha}{1 + \tan \beta \tan \alpha}\]

Now, substituting the values we know into the formula, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{4}{5} &= \frac{\frac{47}{50} - \tan \alpha}{1 + \frac{47}{50} \tan \alpha}
\\
4 (1+ \frac{47}{50} \tan \alpha) &= 5(\frac{47}{50} - 5\tan \alpha )
\end{align*}
\]

Use the distributive property, and then simplify the functions.

\[
\begin{align*}
4 + 4(\frac{47}{50}) \tan \alpha &= 5(\frac{47}{50}) - 5\tan \alpha \\
4 + 3.76 \tan \alpha &= 4.7 - 5 \tan \alpha \\
5 \tan \alpha + 3.76 \tan \alpha &= 0.7 \\
8.76 \tan \alpha &= 0.7 \\
\tan \alpha &\approx 0.07991 \\
\tan^{-1}(0.07991) &\approx .079741
\end{align*}
\]

Now we can calculate the angle in degrees.

\[
\begin{align*}
\alpha &\approx 0.079741 \left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right) \approx 4.57^{\circ}
\end{align*}
\]

\[\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta\]

If we let \[\alpha = \beta = \theta,\] then we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\theta + \theta) &= \sin \theta \cos \theta + \cos \theta \sin \theta \\
\sin(2\theta) &= 2\sin \theta \cos \theta
\end{align*}
\]

Deriving the double-angle for cosine gives us three options. First, starting from the sum formula, \[\cos(α + β) = \cosα \cosβ - \sinα \sinβ,\] and letting \[α = β = θ,\] we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(\theta + \theta) &= \cos \theta \cos \theta - \sin \theta \sin \theta \\
\cos(2\theta) &= \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta
\end{align*}
\]

Using the Pythagorean properties, we can expand this double-angle formula for cosine and get two more interpretations. The first one is:

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(2\theta) &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \\
&= (1 - \sin^2\theta) - \sin^2\theta \\
&= 1 - 2\sin^2\theta
\end{align*}
\]

The second interpretation is:

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(2\theta) &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \\
&= \cos^2\theta - (1 - \cos^2\theta) \\
&= 2\cos^2\theta - 1
\end{align*}
\]

Similarly, to derive the double-angle formula for tangent, replacing \[\alpha = \beta = \theta\] in the sum formula gives

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan(\alpha + \beta) &= \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta} \\
\tan(\theta + \theta) &= \frac{\tan \theta + \tan \theta}{1 - \tan \theta \tan \theta} \\
\tan(2\theta) &= \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\end{align*}
\]

## Double-Angle Formulas

The double-angle formulas are summarized as follows:

\[\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(2\theta) &= \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \\
&= 1 - 2\sin^2\theta \\
&= 2\cos^2\theta - 1
\end{align*}
\]

\[\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan\theta}{1 - \tan^2\theta}\]


## HOW TO

Given the tangent of an angle and the quadrant in which it is located, use the double-angle formulas to find the exact value.

1. Draw a triangle to reflect the given information.
2. Determine the correct double-angle formula.
3. Substitute values into the formula based on the triangle.
4. Simplify.

# Example 1

## Using a Double-Angle Formula to Find the Exact Value Involving Tangent

Given that \[\tan \theta = -\frac{3}{4}\] and \[\theta\] is in quadrant II, find the following:

ⓐ \[\sin(2\theta)\]
ⓑ \[\cos(2\theta)\]
ⓒ \[\tan(2\theta)\]

# Solution:

If we draw a triangle to reflect the information given, we can find the values needed to solve the problems on the image. We are given \[\tan \theta = -\frac{3}{4}\], such that \[\theta\] is in quadrant II. The tangent of an angle is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side, and because \[\theta\] is in the second quadrant, the adjacent side is on the x-axis and is negative. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:

\[
\begin{align*}
(-4)^2 + (3)^2 &= c^2 \\
16 + 9 &= c^2 \\
25 &= c^2 \\
c &= 5
\end{align*}
\]

Now we can draw a triangle similar to the one shown in Figure 2.



Figure 2

ⓐ Let’s begin by writing the double-angle formula for sine.
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
\]
We see that we to need to find \[\sin \theta\] and \[\cos \theta.\] Based on Figure 2, we see that the hypotenuse equals 5, so \[\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}\], and \[\cos \theta = -\frac{4}{5}.\] Substitute these values into the equation, and simplify. Thus,
\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(2\theta) &= 2(-\frac{3}{5})(-\frac{4}{5}) \\
&= -\frac{24}{25}
\end{align*}
\]

ⓑ Write the double-angle formula for cosine.
\[
\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta
\]
Again, substitute the values of the sine and cosine into the equation, and simplify.
\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(2\theta) &= (-\frac{4}{5})^2 - (\frac{3}{5})^2 \\
&= \frac{16}{25} - \frac{9}{25} \\
&= \frac{7}{25}
\end{align*}
\]

ⓒ Write the double-angle formula for tangent.
\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\]
In this formula, we need the tangent, which we were given as \[\tan \theta = -\frac{3}{4}.\] Substitute this value into the equation, and simplify.
\[
\begin{align*}
\tan(2\theta) &= \frac{2(-\frac{3}{4})}{1 - (-\frac{3}{4})^2} \\
&= -\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{16}{7} \\
&= -\frac{24}{7}
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 2

## Using the Double-Angle Formula for Cosine without Exact Values

Use the double-angle formula for cosine to write \[\cos(6x)\] in terms of \[\cos(3x).\]

# Solution:

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(6x) &= \cos(2(3x)) \\
&= \cos^2(3x) - \sin^2(3x) \\
&= 2\cos^2(3x) - 1
\end{align*}
\]

## Analysis
This example illustrates that we can use the double-angle formula without having exact values. It emphasizes that the pattern is what we need to remember and that identities are true for all values in the domain of the trigonometric function.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/5ba762a90a8ac6b1d923a05bcd251d24554eae30""]",Precalculus 2e,Using Double-Angle Formulas to Find Exact Values,"Double-Angle, Half-Angle, and Reduction Formulas",Trigonometric Identities and Equations
968_concept_1,concept,968,"# Using Double-Angle Formulas to Verify Identities

Establishing identities using the double-angle formulas is performed using the same steps we used to derive the sum and difference formulas. Choose the more complicated side of the equation and rewrite it until it matches the other side.

# Example 3

#### Using the Double-Angle Formulas to Establish an Identity
Establish the following identity using double-angle formulas:
\[
1 + \sin(2\theta) = (\sin \theta + \cos \theta)^2
\]

# Solution:

We will work on the right side of the equal sign and rewrite the expression until it matches the left side.

\[
\begin{align*}
(\sin θ + \cos θ)^2 &= \sin^2 θ + 2 \sin θ \cos θ + \cos^2 θ \\
&= (\sin^2 θ + \cos^2 θ) + 2 \sin θ \cos θ \\
&= 1 + 2 \sin θ \cos θ \\
&= 1 + \sin(2θ)
\end{align*}
\]

## Analysis 

This process is not complicated, as long as we recall the perfect square formula from algebra:

\[(a ± b)^2 = a^2 ± 2ab + b^2\]

where \(a = \sin θ\) and \(b = \cos θ\). Part of being successful in mathematics is the ability to recognize patterns. While the terms or symbols may change, the algebra remains consistent.

# Example 4

# Verifying a Double-Angle Identity for Tangent 

Verify the identity:

\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2}{\cot\theta - \tan\theta}
\]

# Solution:

In this case, we will work with the left side of the equation and simplify or rewrite until it equals the right side of the equation.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} & \text{Double-angle formula} \\
= \frac{2 \tan \theta ( \frac{1}{\tan \theta})}{(1 - \tan^2 \theta)( \frac{1}{\tan \theta})} & \text{Multiply by a term that results in desired numerator.} \\
= \frac{2 - \frac{\tan^2 \theta}{\tan \theta}}{1} & \\
= \frac{2}{\cot \theta - \tan \theta} & \text{Use reciprocal identity for } \frac{1}{\tan \theta}.
\end{array}
\]

Here is a case where the more complicated side of the initial equation appeared on the right, but we chose to work the left side. However, if we had chosen the left side to rewrite, we would have been working backwards to arrive at the equivalency. For example, suppose that we wanted to show

\[
\frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} = \frac{2}{\cot \theta - \tan \theta}
\]

Let’s work on the right side.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{2}{\cot \theta - \tan \theta} &= \frac{2}{ \frac{1}{\tan \theta} - \tan \theta} \left( \frac{\tan\theta}{\tan\theta} \right)  \\
\\
&= \frac{2}{ \frac{1}{\cancel \tan \theta} (\cancel \tan \theta) - \tan\theta(\tan\theta)}  \\
\\
&= \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} & \\
\end{array}
\]

When using the identities to simplify a trigonometric expression or solve a trigonometric equation, there are usually several paths to a desired result. There is no set rule as to what side should be manipulated. However, we should begin with the guidelines set forth earlier.",[],Precalculus 2e,Using Double-Angle Formulas to Verify Identities,"Double-Angle, Half-Angle, and Reduction Formulas",Trigonometric Identities and Equations
969_concept_1,concept,969,"# Use Reduction Formulas to Simplify an Expression

The double-angle formulas can be used to derive the reduction formulas, which are formulas we can use to reduce the power of a given expression involving even powers of sine or cosine. They allow us to rewrite the even powers of sine or cosine in terms of the first power of cosine. These formulas are especially important in higher-level math courses, calculus in particular. Also called the power-reducing formulas, three identities are included and are easily derived from the double-angle formulas.

We can use two of the three double-angle formulas for cosine to derive the reduction formulas for sine and cosine. Let’s begin with \[\cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 θ.\] Solve for \[\sin^2 θ:\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(2\theta) &= 1 - 2\sin^2\theta \\
2\sin^2\theta &= 1 - \cos(2\theta) \\
\sin^2\theta &= \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}
\end{align*}
\]

Next, we use the formula \[\cos(2θ) = 2\cos^2θ - 1.\] Solve for \[\cos^2θ:\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(2\theta) &= 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \\
1 + \cos(2\theta) &= 2\cos^2\theta \\
\frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} &= \cos^2\theta
\end{align*}
\]

The last reduction formula is derived by writing tangent in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
\begin{align*}
\tan^2 \theta & = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} \\
& = \frac{\frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}}{\frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}} \quad \text{Substitute the reduction formulas} \\
& = \left(\frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2}{1 + \cos(2\theta)}\right) \\
& = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{1 + \cos(2\theta)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

## Reduction Formulas

The reduction formulas are summarized as follows:

\[\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}\]

\[\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}\]

\[\tan^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{1 + \cos(2\theta)}\]

# Example 5

## Writing an Equivalent Expression Not Containing Powers Greater Than 1

Write an equivalent expression for \[\cos^4x\] that does not involve any powers of sine or cosine greater than 1.

# Solution:

We will apply the reduction formula for cosine twice.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos^4x &= (\cos^2x)^2 \\
&= \left(\frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2}\right)^2 \quad &\text{Substitute reduction formula for } \cos^2x. \\
&= \frac{1}{4}(1 + 2\cos(2x) + \cos^2(2x)) \\
&= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2x) + \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1 + \cos(4x)}{2}\right) \quad &\text{Substitute reduction formula for } \cos^2x. \\
&= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2x) + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8}\cos(4x) \\
&= \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2x) + \frac{1}{8}\cos(4x)
\end{align*}
\]

## Analysis

The solution is found by using the reduction formula twice, as noted, and the perfect square formula from algebra.

# Example 6

## Using the Power-Reducing Formulas to Prove an Identity

Use the power-reducing formulas to prove

\[\sin^3(2x) = \left[\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)\right]\left[1 - \cos(4x)\right]\]

# Solution:

We will work on simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
  \begin{align*}
\sin^3(2x) & = [\sin(2x)][\sin^2(2x)] \\
& = \sin(2x)\left[\frac{1 - \cos(4x)}{2}\right] \quad \text{Substitute the power-reduction formula} \\
& = \sin(2x)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)[1 - \cos(4x)] \\
& = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(2x)][1 - \cos(4x)] \\
\end{align*}

  \]

## Analysis 

Note that in this example, we substituted \[\frac{1−\cos(4x)}{2}\] for \[\sin^2(2x).\] The formula states \[\sin^2θ = \frac{1−\cos(2θ)}{2}\].
 We let \[θ=2x,\] so \[2θ=4x.\]",[],Precalculus 2e,Use Reduction Formulas to Simplify an Expression,"Double-Angle, Half-Angle, and Reduction Formulas",Trigonometric Identities and Equations
970_concept_1,concept,970,"#  Using Half-Angle Formulas to Find Exact Values 

The next set of identities is the set of half-angle formulas, which can be derived from the reduction formulas and we can use when we have an angle that is half the size of a special angle. If we replace \[\theta\] with \[\frac{\alpha}{2},\] the half-angle formula for sine is found by simplifying the equation and solving for \[\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right).\] Note that the half-angle formulas are preceded by a \[±\] sign. This does not mean that both the positive and negative expressions are valid. Rather, it depends on the quadrant in which \[\frac{\alpha}{2}\] terminates.

The half-angle formula for sine is derived as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin^2\theta &= \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2} \\
\sin^2\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) &= \frac{1 - \cos(2 \cdot \frac{\alpha}{2})}{2} \\
&= \frac{1 - \cos\alpha}{2} \\
\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\alpha}{2}}
\end{align*}
\]

To derive the half-angle formula for cosine, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos^2θ &= \frac{1+cos(2θ)}{2} \\
\cos^2\left(\frac{α}{2}\right) &= \frac{1+cos(2\cdot\frac{α}{2})}{2} \\
&= \frac{1+\cosα}{2} \\
\cos\left(\frac{α}{2}\right) &= ±\sqrt{\frac{1+\cosα}{2}}
\end{align*}
\]

For the tangent identity, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan^2 \theta &= \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{1 + \cos(2\theta)} \\
\tan^2 \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) &= \frac{1 - \cos\left(2 \cdot \frac{\alpha}{2}\right)}{1 + \cos\left(2 \cdot \frac{\alpha}{2}\right)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \cos \alpha}{1 + \cos \alpha} \\
\tan \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \alpha}{1 + \cos \alpha}}
\end{align*}
\]

# Half-Angle Formulas

The half-angle formulas are as follows:

\[\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\alpha}{2}}\]

\[\cos\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\alpha}{2}}\]

\[\tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\alpha}{1 + \cos\alpha}}\]
\[\tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \frac{\sin\alpha}{1 + \cos\alpha}\]
\[\tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \frac{1 - \cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\]

# Example 7

# Using a Half-Angle Formula to Find the Exact Value of a Sine Function

Find \[sin(15^∘)\] using a half-angle formula.

# Solution:

Since \[15^∘ = \frac{30^∘}{2}\], we use the half-angle formula for sine:

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin\left(\frac{30^∘}{2}\right) &= \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos30^∘}{2}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} \\
&=\sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{4}} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}}}{2}
\end{align*}
\]

Analysis 

Notice that we used only the positive root because \[\sin(15^o)\] is positive.

**How To**

**Given the tangent of an angle and the quadrant in which the angle lies, find the exact values of trigonometric functions of half of the angle.**

1. Draw a triangle to represent the given information.
2. Determine the correct half-angle formula.
3. Substitute values into the formula based on the triangle.
4. Simplify.

# Example 8

# Finding Exact Values Using Half-Angle Identities

Given that \[\tan \alpha = \frac{8}{15}\] and \[\alpha\] lies in quadrant III, find the exact value of the following:

1. ⓐ \[\sin(\frac{\alpha}{2})\]
2. ⓑ \[\cos(\frac{\alpha}{2})\]
3. ⓒ \[\tan(\frac{\alpha}{2})\]

# Solution:

Using the given information, we can draw the triangle shown in Figure 3. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we find the hypotenuse to be 17. Therefore, we can calculate \[\sin \alpha = -\frac{8}{17}\] and \[\cos \alpha = -\frac{15}{17}.\]



Figure 3

1. Before we start, we must remember that, if \[\alpha\] is in quadrant III, then \[180° < \alpha < 270°,\] so \[\frac{180°}{2} < \frac{\alpha}{2} < \frac{270°}{2}.\] This means that the terminal side of \[\frac{\alpha}{2}\] is in quadrant II, since \[90° < \frac{\alpha}{2} < 135°.\]

To find \[\sin \frac{\alpha}{2},\] we begin by writing the half-angle formula for sine. Then we substitute the value of the cosine we found from the triangle in Figure 3 and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin \frac{\alpha}{2} &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \alpha}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - (-\frac{15}{17})}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{\frac{32}{17}}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{32}{17} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{16}{17}} \\
&= \pm \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{17}}{17}
\end{align*}
\]

We choose the positive value of \[\sin \frac{\alpha}{2}\] because the angle terminates in quadrant II and sine is positive in quadrant II.

2. To find \[\cos \frac{\alpha}{2},\] we will write the half-angle formula for cosine, substitute the value of the cosine we found from the triangle in Figure 3, and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \frac{\alpha}{2} &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \alpha}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + (-\frac{15}{17})}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2}{17}}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{17} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{17}} \\
&= -\frac{\sqrt{17}}{17}
\end{align*}
\]

We choose the negative value of \[\cos \frac{\alpha}{2}\] because the angle is in quadrant II because cosine is negative in quadrant II.

3. To find \[\tan \frac{\alpha}{2},\] we write the half-angle formula for tangent. Again, we substitute the value of the cosine we found from the triangle in Figure 3 and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \frac{\alpha}{2} &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \alpha}{1 + \cos \alpha}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - (-\frac{15}{17})}{1 + (-\frac{15}{17})}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{\frac{\frac{32}{17}}{\frac{2}{17}}} \\
&= \pm \sqrt{16} \\
&= -4
\end{align*}
\]

We choose the negative value of \[\tan \frac{\alpha}{2}\] because \[\frac{\alpha}{2}\] lies in quadrant II, and tangent is negative in quadrant II.

# Example 9

# Finding the Measurement of a Half Angle 

Now, we will return to the problem posed at the beginning of the section. A bicycle ramp is constructed for high-level competition with an angle of \[\theta\] formed by the ramp and the ground. Another ramp is to be constructed half as steep for novice competition. If \[tan \theta = \frac{5}{3}\] for higher-level competition, what is the measurement of the angle for novice competition?

# Solution:

Since the angle for novice competition measures half the steepness of the angle for the high-level competition, and \(\tan \theta = \frac{5}{3}\) for high-competition, we can find \(\cos \theta\) from the right triangle and the Pythagorean theorem so that we can use the half-angle identities. See Figure 4.

\[
\begin{align*}
3^2 + 5^2 &= 34 \\
c &= \sqrt{34}
\end{align*}
\]



Figure 4

We see that \(\cos \theta = \frac{3}{\sqrt{34}} = \frac{3\sqrt{34}}{34}\). We can use the half-angle formula for tangent: \(\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}}\). Since \(\tan \theta\) is in the first quadrant, so is \(\tan \frac{\theta}{2}\). Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \frac{\theta}{2} &= \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{3\sqrt{34}}{34}}{1 + \frac{3\sqrt{34}}{34}}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{\frac{34 - 3\sqrt{34}}{34}}{\frac{34 + 3\sqrt{34}}{34}}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{34 - 3\sqrt{34}}{34 + 3\sqrt{34}}} \\
&\approx 0.57
\end{align*}
\]

We can take the inverse tangent to find the angle: \(\tan^{-1}(0.57) \approx 29.7^{\circ}\). So the angle of the ramp for novice competition is \(\approx 29.7^{\circ}\).

972_concept_1,concept,972,"# Expressing Products as Sums

We have already learned a number of formulas useful for expanding or simplifying trigonometric expressions, but sometimes we may need to express the product of cosine and sine as a sum. We can use the product-to-sum formulas, which express products of trigonometric functions as sums. Let’s investigate the cosine identity first and then the sine identity.

Expressing Products as Sums for Cosine

We can derive the product-to-sum formula from the sum and difference identities for cosine. If we add the two equations, we get:

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta = \cos(\alpha - \beta) \\
+ \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta = \cos(\alpha + \beta) \\
\hline
2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta = \cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta)
\end{align*}
\]

Then, we divide by \[2\] to isolate the product of cosines:

\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

**How To**

**Given a product of cosines, express as a sum.**

1. Write the formula for the product of cosines.
2. Substitute the given angles into the formula.
3. Simplify.

Write the following product of cosines as a sum: \[2 \cos\left(\frac{7x}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{3x}{2}\right)\]

# Solution:

We begin by writing the formula for the product of cosines:

\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

We can then substitute the given angles into the formula and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
2 \cos \left(\frac{7x}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{3x}{2}\right) &= 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left[\cos \left(\frac{7x}{2} - \frac{3x}{2}\right) + \cos \left(\frac{7x}{2} + \frac{3x}{2}\right)\right] \\
&= \left[\cos \left(\frac{4x}{2}\right) + \cos \left(\frac{10x}{2}\right)\right] \\
&= \cos 2x + \cos 5x
\end{align*}
\]

Expressing the Product of Sine and Cosine as a Sum

Next, we will derive the product-to-sum formula for sine and cosine from the sum and difference formulas for sine. If we add the sum and difference identities, we get:

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(\alpha + \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
+ \sin(\alpha - \beta) &= \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
\hline
\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta) &= 2 \sin \alpha \cos \beta
\end{align*}
\]

Then, we divide by 2 to isolate the product of cosine and sine:

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta)]
\]

# Example 2

### Writing the Product as a Sum Containing only Sine or Cosine

Express the following product as a sum containing only sine or cosine and no products: \[\sin(4\theta)\cos(2\theta).\]

# Solution:

Write the formula for the product of sine and cosine. Then substitute the given values into the formula and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin \alpha \cos \beta &= \frac{1}{2} [\sin (\alpha + \beta) + \sin (\alpha - \beta)] \\
\sin (4\theta) \cos (2\theta) &= \frac{1}{2} [\sin (4\theta + 2\theta) + \sin (4\theta - 2\theta)] \\
&= \frac{1}{2} [\sin (6\theta) + \sin (2\theta)]
\end{align*}
\]

Expressing Products of Sines in Terms of Cosine

Expressing the product of sines in terms of cosine is also derived from the sum and difference identities for cosine. In this case, we will first subtract the two cosine formulas:

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(\alpha - \beta) &= \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta \\
-\cos(\alpha + \beta) &= -(\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta) \\
\hline
\cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta) &= 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\end{align*}
\]

Then, we divide by 2 to isolate the product of sines:

\[\sin \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [ \cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta) ]\]

Similarly we could express the product of cosines in terms of sine or derive other product-to-sum formulas.

# The Product-to-Sum Formulas

The product-to-sum formulas are as follows:

\[
\cos \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta)]
\]

\[
\sin \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

\[
\cos \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\alpha + \beta) - \sin(\alpha - \beta)]
\]

# Example 3

# Express the Product as a Sum or Difference

Write \[cos(3θ) cos(5θ)\] as a sum or difference.

# Solution:

We have the product of cosines, so we begin by writing the related formula. Then we substitute the given angles and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \alpha \cos \beta &= \frac{1}{2}[\cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta) \\
\cos(3\theta) \cos(5\theta) &= \frac{1}{2}[\cos(3\theta - 5\theta) + \cos(3\theta + 5\theta)] \\
&= \frac{1}{2}[\cos(2\theta) + \cos(8\theta)  &&&\text{Use even-odd identity.}
\end{align*}

973_concept_1,concept,973,"# Expressing Sums as Products

Some problems require the reverse of the process we just used. The sum-to-product formulas allow us to express sums of sine or cosine as products. These formulas can be derived from the product-to-sum identities. For example, with a few substitutions, we can derive the sum-to-product identity for sine. Let \[\frac{u+v}{2} = \alpha\] and \[\frac{u-v}{2} = \beta.\]

Then,

\[
\begin{align*}
\alpha + \beta &= \frac{u + v}{2} + \frac{u - v}{2} \\
&= \frac{2u}{2} \\
&= u \\
\alpha - \beta &= \frac{u + v}{2} - \frac{u - v}{2} \\
&= \frac{2v}{2} \\
&= v \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, replacing \[\alpha\] and \[\beta\] in the product-to-sum formula with the substitute expressions, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin \alpha \cos \beta &= \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\alpha + \beta) + \sin(\alpha - \beta)] \\
\sin\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{u-v}{2}\right) &= \frac{1}{2} [\sin u + \sin v] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{Substitute for} \ (\alpha + \beta) \ \text{and} \ (\alpha - \beta) \\
2 \sin\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{u-v}{2}\right) &= \sin u + \sin v 
\end{align*}
\]


The other sum-to-product identities are derived similarly.

### Sum-to-Product Formulas

The sum-to-product formulas are as follows:

\[\sin α + \sin β = 2 \sin \left( \frac{α + β}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{α - β}{2} \right)\]

\[\sin α - \sin β = 2 \sin \left( \frac{α - β}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{α + β}{2} \right)\]

\[\cos α - \cos β = -2 \sin \left( \frac{α + β}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{α - β}{2} \right)\]

\[\cos α + \cos β = 2 \cos \left( \frac{α + β}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{α - β}{2} \right)\]

# Example 4

# Writing the Difference of Sines as a Product

Write the following difference of sines expression as a product: \[\sin(4\theta) - \sin(2\theta)\]

# Solution:

We begin by writing the formula for the difference of sines.

\[
\sin \alpha - \sin \beta = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\alpha - \beta}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \right)
\]

Substitute the values into the formula, and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(4\theta) - \sin(2\theta) &= 2 \sin \left( \frac{4\theta - 2\theta}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\theta + 2\theta}{2} \right) \\
&= 2 \sin \left( \frac{2\theta}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\theta}{2} \right) \\
&= 2 \sin \theta \cos(3\theta)
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 5

# Evaluating Using the Sum-to-Product Formula

Evaluate \[\cos(15^∘) - \cos(75^∘).\]

# Solution:

We begin by writing the formula for the difference of cosines.

\[
\cos \alpha - \cos \beta = -2 \sin \left(\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{\alpha - \beta}{2}\right)
\]

Then we substitute the given angles and simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(15^{\circ}) - \cos(75^{\circ}) &= -2 \sin \left(\frac{15^{\circ} + 75^{\circ}}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{15^{\circ} - 75^{\circ}}{2}\right) \\
&= -2 \sin(45^{\circ}) \sin(-30^{\circ}) \\
&= -2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

\]

# Example 6

### Proving an Identity
Prove the identity:
\[
\frac{{\cos(4t) - \cos(2t)}}{{\sin(4t) + \sin(2t)}} = -\tan t
\]

# Solution:

We will start with the left side, the more complicated side of the equation, and rewrite the expression until it matches the right side.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\cos(4t) - \cos(2t)}{\sin(4t) + \sin(2t)} &= \frac{-2 \sin\left(\frac{4t + 2t}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{4t - 2t}{2}\right)}{2 \sin\left(\frac{4t + 2t}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4t - 2t}{2}\right)} \\
&= \frac{-2 \sin(3t) \sin(t)}{2 \sin(3t) \cos(t)} \\
&= \frac{-\cancel{2} \cancel{\sin(3t)} \sin(t)}{\cancel{2} \cancel{\sin(3t)} \cos(t)} \\
&= -\frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)} \\
&= -\tan(t)
\end{align*}
\]

### Analysis

Recall that verifying trigonometric identities has its own set of rules. The procedures for solving an equation are not the same as the procedures for verifying an identity. When we prove an identity, we pick one side to work on and make substitutions until that side is transformed into the other side.

# Example 7

# Verifying the Identity Using Double-Angle Formulas and Reciprocal Identities

Verify the identity \[\csc^2θ - 2 = \frac{\cos(2θ)}{\sin^2θ}\]

# Solution:

For verifying this equation, we are bringing together several of the identities. We will use the double-angle formula and the reciprocal identities. We will work with the right side of the equation and rewrite it until it matches the left side.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\cos(2\theta)}{\sin^2\theta} &= \frac{1 - 2\sin^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta} - \frac{2\sin^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta} \\
&= \csc^2\theta - 2
\end{align*}

Figure 1: Egyptian pyramids standing near a modern city. (credit: Oisin Mulvihill)

Thales of Miletus (circa 625–547 BC) is known as the founder of geometry. The legend is that he calculated the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt using the theory of *similar triangles*, which he developed by measuring the shadow of his staff. Based on proportions, this theory has applications in a number of areas, including fractal geometry, engineering, and architecture. Often, the angle of elevation and the angle of depression are found using similar triangles.

In earlier sections of this chapter, we looked at trigonometric identities. Identities are true for all values in the domain of the variable. In this section, we begin our study of trigonometric equations to study real-world scenarios such as the finding the dimensions of the pyramids.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/e5b7031605c1e4f8df6620684bb27f535d5bcf16""]",Precalculus 2e,Solving Trigonometric Equations,Solving Trigonometric Equations,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
975_concept_1,concept,975,"# Solving Linear Trigonometric Equations in Sine and Cosine

Trigonometric equations are, as the name implies, equations that involve trigonometric functions. Similar in many ways to solving polynomial equations or rational equations, only specific values of the variable will be solutions, if there are solutions at all. Often we will solve a trigonometric equation over a specified interval. However, just as often, we will be asked to find all possible solutions, and as trigonometric functions are periodic, solutions are repeated within each period. In other words, trigonometric equations may have an infinite number of solutions. Additionally, like rational equations, the domain of the function must be considered before we assume that any solution is valid. The period of both the sine function and the cosine function is \[2\pi.\] In other words, every \[2\pi\] units, the \[y\]-values repeat. If we need to find all possible solutions, then we must add \[2\pi k,\] where \[k\] is an integer, to the initial solution. Recall the rule that gives the format for stating all possible solutions for a function where the period is \[2\pi:\]

\[\sin \theta = \sin(\theta \pm 2k\pi)\]

There are similar rules for indicating all possible solutions for the other trigonometric functions. Solving trigonometric equations requires the same techniques as solving algebraic equations. We read the equation from left to right, horizontally, like a sentence. We look for known patterns, factor, find common denominators, and substitute certain expressions with a variable to make solving a more straightforward process. However, with trigonometric equations, we also have the advantage of using the identities we developed in the previous sections.

# Example 1

# Solving a Linear Trigonometric Equation Involving the Cosine Function

Find all possible exact solutions for the equation \[cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}\].

# Solution:

From the unit circle, we know that

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{1}{2} \\
\theta &= \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{3}
\end{align*}
\]

These are the solutions in the interval \[0, 2\pi\]. All possible solutions are given by

\[
\frac{\pi}{3} \pm 2k\pi \text{ and } \frac{5\pi}{3} \pm 2k\pi
\]

where \(k\) is an integer.

# Example 2

# Solving a Linear Equation Involving the Sine Function

Find all possible exact solutions for the equation \[\sin t = \frac{1}{2}\]

# Solution:

Solving for all possible values of \[t\] means that solutions include angles beyond the period of \[2\pi.\] From Figure 2, we can see that the solutions are \[\frac{\pi}{6}\] and \[\frac{5\pi}{6}.\] But the problem is asking for all possible values that solve the equation. Therefore, the answer is

\[\frac{\pi}{6} \pm 2\pi k \text{ and } \frac{5\pi}{6} \pm 2\pi k\]

where \[k\] is an integer.

# How To

**Given a trigonometric equation, solve using algebra.**

1. Look for a pattern that suggests an algebraic property, such as the difference of squares or a factoring opportunity.
2. Substitute the trigonometric expression with a single variable, such as \[x\] or \[u.\]
3. Solve the equation the same way an algebraic equation would be solved.
4. Substitute the trigonometric expression back in for the variable in the resulting expressions.
5. Solve for the angle.

# Solution:

Use algebraic techniques to solve the equation.

2 \cos \theta &= -2 \\
\cos \theta &= -1 \\
\theta &= \pi

976_concept_1,concept,976,"# Solving Equations Involving a Single Trigonometric Function

When we are given equations that involve only one of the six trigonometric functions, their solutions involve using algebraic techniques and the unit circle (see Figure 2). We need to make several considerations when the equation involves trigonometric functions other than sine and cosine. Problems involving the reciprocals of the primary trigonometric functions need to be viewed from an algebraic perspective. In other words, we will write the reciprocal function, and solve for the angles using the function. Also, an equation involving the tangent function is slightly different from one containing a sine or cosine function. First, as we know, the period of tangent is \[\pi,\] not \[2\pi.\] Further, the domain of tangent is all real numbers with the exception of odd integer multiples of \[\frac{\pi}{2},\] unless, of course, a problem places its own restrictions on the domain.

# Example 4

# Solving a Problem Involving a Single Trigonometric Function

Solve the problem exactly: \[2 \sin^2 \theta - 1 = 0, 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi.\]

# Solution:

As this problem is not easily factored, we will solve using the square root property. First, we use algebra to isolate \[sinθ.\] Then we will find the angles.

\[
\begin{align*}
2 \sin^2θ - 1 &= 0 \\
2 \sin^2θ &= 1 \\
\sin^2θ &= \frac{1}{2} \\

# Example 5

### Solving a Trigonometric Equation Involving Cosecant
Solve the following equation exactly: \[\csc \theta = -2, 0 \leq \theta < 4\pi.\]

# Solution:

We want all values of \[\theta\] for which \[\csc \theta = -2\] over the interval \[0 \leq \theta < 4\pi.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\csc \theta &= -2 & \\
\frac{1}{\sin \theta} &= -2 & \\
\sin \theta &= -\frac{1}{2} & \\
\theta &= \frac{7\pi}{6}, \frac{11\pi}{6}, \frac{19\pi}{6}, \frac{23\pi}{6} &
\end{align*}

**Analysis**

As \[\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{2}\], notice that all four solutions are in the third and fourth quadrants.

# Example 6

# Solving an Equation Involving Tangent
Solve the equation exactly: \[tan(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}) = 1, 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi.\]

# Solution:

Recall that the tangent function has a period of \[\pi.\] On the interval \[[0, \pi)\] and at the angle of \[\frac{\pi}{4},\] the tangent has a value of 1. However, the angle we want is \[(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}).\] Thus, if \[\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}) = 1,\] then

\[
\begin{align*}
\theta - \frac{\pi}{2} &= \frac{\pi}{4} \\
\theta &= \frac{3\pi}{4} \pm k\pi
\end{align*}
\]

Over the interval \[[0, 2\pi)\] we have two solutions:

\[
\frac{3\pi}{4} \text{ and } \frac{3\pi}{4} + \pi = \frac{7\pi}{4}
\]

# Example 7

# Identify all Solutions to the Equation Involving Tangent

Identify all exact solutions to the equation \[2(tan x + 3) = 5 + tan x, 0 \leq x < 2\pi.\]

# Solution:

We can solve this equation using only algebra. Isolate the expression \[tan x\] on the left side of the equals sign.

\[
\begin{align*}
2(\tan x) + 2(3) &= 5 + \tan x \\
2 \tan x + 6 &= 5 + \tan x \\
2 \tan x - \tan x &= 5 - 6 \\
\tan x &= -1 \\

977_concept_1,concept,977,"# Solve Trigonometric Equations Using a Calculator

Not all functions can be solved exactly using only the unit circle. When we must solve an equation involving an angle other than one of the special angles, we will need to use a calculator. Make sure it is set to the proper mode, either degrees or radians, depending on the criteria of the given problem.

# Example 8

# Using a Calculator to Solve a Trigonometric Equation Involving Sine

Use a calculator to solve the equation \[\sin \theta = 0.8,\] where \[\theta\] is in radians.

# Solution:

Make sure mode is set to radians. To find \[\theta,\] use the inverse sine function. On most calculators, you will need to push the 2\[^{ND}\] button and then the SIN button to bring up the \[\sin^{-1}\] function. What is shown on the screen is \[\sin^{-1}(.\] The calculator is ready for the input within the parentheses. For this problem, we enter \[\sin^{-1}(0.8),\] and press ENTER. Thus, to four decimals places,

\[\sin^{-1}(0.8) \approx 0.9273\]

The solution is

\[0.9273 \pm 2\pi k\]

The angle measurement in degrees is

\[
\begin{align*}
\theta &\approx 53.1^{\circ} \\
\theta &\approx 180^{\circ} - 53.1^{\circ} \\
&\approx 126.9^{\circ}
\end{align*}
\]

Analysis

Note that a calculator will only return an angle in quadrants I or IV for the sine function, since that is the range of the inverse sine. The other angle is obtained by using \[\pi - \theta.\]

# Example 9

#### Using a Calculator to Solve a Trigonometric Equation Involving Secant
Use a calculator to solve the equation \[\sec \theta = -4,\] giving your answer in radians.

# Solution:

We can begin with some algebra.

\[
\begin{align*}
\sec θ &= -4 \\
\frac{1}{\cos θ} &= -4 \\
\cos θ &= -\frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}
\]

Check that the MODE is in radians. Now use the inverse cosine function.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) &\approx 1.8235 \\
θ &\approx 1.8235 + 2πk
\end{align*}
\]

Since \(\frac{π}{2} \approx 1.57\) and \(π \approx 3.14\), 1.8235 is between these two numbers, thus \(θ \approx 1.8235\) is in quadrant II. Cosine is also negative in quadrant III. Note that a calculator will only return an angle in quadrants I or II for the cosine function, since that is the range of the inverse cosine.  See Figure 2.



Figure 2

So, we also need to find the measure of the angle in quadrant III. In quadrant III, the reference angle is \(θ' \approx π - 1.8235 \approx 1.3181.\) The other solution in quadrant III is \(π + 1.3181 \approx 4.4597.\)

The solutions are \(1.8235 ± 2πk\) and \(4.4597 ± 2πk.\)","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/eba157008b2c810c6dbb0fbea3fe22b941e0f397""]",Precalculus 2e,Solve Trigonometric Equations Using a Calculator,Solving Trigonometric Equations,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
978_concept_1,concept,978,"# Solving Trigonometric Equations in Quadratic Form

Solving a quadratic equation may be more complicated, but once again, we can use algebra as we would for any quadratic equation. Look at the pattern of the equation. Is there more than one trigonometric function in the equation, or is there only one? Which trigonometric function is squared? If there is only one function represented and one of the terms is squared, think about the standard form of a quadratic. Replace the trigonometric function with a variable such as \[x\] or \[u.\] If substitution makes the equation look like a quadratic equation, then we can use the same methods for solving quadratics to solve the trigonometric equations.

#### Example 10

# Solving a Trigonometric Equation in Quadratic Form

Solve the equation exactly: \[\cos^2θ + 3\cosθ - 1 = 0, 0 ≤ θ < 2π.\]

# Solution:

We begin by using substitution and replacing cos \(\theta\) with \(x\). It is not necessary to use substitution, but it may make the problem easier to solve visually. Let \(\cos \theta = x\). We have

\[
x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0
\]

The equation cannot be factored, so we will use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{(3)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} \\
  &= \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}
\end{align*}
\]

Replace \(x\) with \(\cos \theta\), and solve. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2} \\
\theta &= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\right)
\end{align*}
\]

Note that only the + sign is used. This is because we get an error when we solve \(\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-3 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\right)\) on a calculator, since the domain of the inverse cosine function is \([-1, 1]\). However, there is a second solution:

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\right) &\approx 1.26
\end{align*}
\]

This terminal side of the angle lies in quadrant I. Since cosine is also positive in quadrant IV, the second solution is

\[

2\pi - cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\right) \\
\approx 5.02

\]

#### Example 11

# Solving a Trigonometric Equation in Quadratic Form by Factoring

Solve the equation exactly: \[2 \sin^2 θ - 5 \sin θ + 3 = 0, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π.\]

# Solution:

Using grouping, this quadratic can be factored. Either make the real substitution, \[\sin \theta = u,\] or imagine it, as we factor:

2 \(\sin^2 \theta - 5 \sin \theta + 3 = 0\)
\[(2 \sin \theta - 3)(\sin \theta - 1) = 0\] 

Now set each factor equal to zero.


2 \[\sin \theta - 3 = 0\] 
2 \[\sin \theta = 3\] 
\[\sin \theta = \frac{3}{2}\]
\
\[\sin \theta - 1 = 0\]
\[\sin \theta = 1\]
\
Next solve for \[\theta: sin \theta ≠ \frac{3}{2},\] as the range of the sine function is \[[-1,1].\] However, \[\sin \theta = 1,\] giving the solution \[\frac{π}{2}.\]

# Analysis

Make sure to check all solutions on the given domain as some factors have no solution.

#### Example 12

# Solving a Trigonometric Equation Using Algebra
Solve exactly:
\[
2 \sin^2 \theta + \sin \theta = 0; 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi
\]

# Solution:

This problem should appear familiar as it is similar to a quadratic. Let \(\sin \theta = x\). The equation becomes \(2x^2 + x = 0\). We begin by factoring:


\(2x^2 + x = 0\)
\(x(2x + 1) = 0\)

Set each factor equal to zero.

\(x = 0\)
\(2x + 1 = 0\)
\(x = -\frac{1}{2}\)

Then, substitute back into the equation the original expression \(\sin \theta\) for \(x\). Thus,


\(\sin \theta = 0\)
\(\theta = 0, \pi\) 
\
\(\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{2}\)
\(\theta = \frac{7\pi}{6}, \frac{11\pi}{6}\) 

The solutions within the domain \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\) are \(0, \pi, \frac{7\pi}{6}, \frac{11\pi}{6}\).

If we prefer not to substitute, we can solve the equation by following the same pattern of factoring and setting each factor equal to zero.

\(2\sin^2 \theta + \sin \theta = 0\)

# Analysis

We can see the solutions on the graph in Figure 3. On the interval \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\), the graph crosses the x-axis four times, at the solutions noted. Notice that trigonometric equations that are in quadratic form can yield up to four solutions instead of the expected two that are found with quadratic equations. In this example, each solution (angle) corresponding to a positive sine value will yield two angles that would result in that value.

979_concept_1,concept,979,"# Solving Trigonometric Equations Using Fundamental Identities

While algebra can be used to solve a number of trigonometric equations, we can also use the fundamental identities because they make solving equations simpler. Remember that the techniques we use for solving are not the same as those for verifying identities. The basic rules of algebra apply here, as opposed to rewriting one side of the identity to match the other side. In the next example, we use two identities to simplify the equation.

#### Example 14

# Use Identities to Solve an Equation

Use identities to solve exactly the trigonometric equation over the interval \[0 ≤ x < 2π.\]

\[\cos x \cos(2x) + \sin x \sin(2x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\]

# Solution:

Notice that the left side of the equation is the difference formula for cosine.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\cos x \cos(2x) + \sin x \sin(2x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \\
\cos(x - 2x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \text{Difference formula for cosine} \\
\cos(-x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \text{Use the negative angle identity.} \\
\cos x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \\
\end{array}
\]

From the unit circle in Figure 2, we see that \(\cos x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) when \(x = \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{11\pi}{6}\).

#### Example 15

# Solving the Equation Using a Double-Angle Formula
Solve the equation exactly using a double-angle formula: \[\cos(2\theta) = \cos\theta.\]

# Solution:

We have three choices of expressions to substitute for the double-angle of cosine. As it is simpler to solve for one trigonometric function at a time, we will choose the double-angle identity involving only cosine:


\[\cos(2θ) = \cos θ\]
\[2\cos^2θ - 1 = \cos θ\]
\[2\cos^2θ - \cos θ - 1 = 0\]
\[(2\cos θ + 1)(\cos θ - 1) = 0\]
\[2\cos θ + 1 = 0\]
\[\cos θ = -\frac{1}{2}\]
\
\[\cos θ - 1 = 0\]
\[\cos θ = 1\]

So, if \[\cos θ = -\frac{1}{2}\], then \[θ = \frac{2π}{3} ± 2πk\] and \[θ = \frac{4π}{3} ± 2πk;\] if \[\cos θ = 1\], then \[θ = 0 ± 2πk.\]

#### Example 16

# Solving an Equation Using an Identity

Solve the equation exactly using an identity: \[3 \cos \theta + 3 = 2 \sin^2 \theta, 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi.\]

# Solution:

If we rewrite the right side, we can write the equation in terms of cosine:


\(3 \cos θ + 3=2 \sin^2 θ\)
\(3 \cos θ + 3=2(1−\cos^2 θ)\)
\(3 \cos θ + 3=2−2 \cos^2 θ \)
\(2 \cos^2 θ + 3 \cos θ + 1=0 \)
\((2 \cos θ + 1)(\cos θ + 1)=0 \)
\(2 \cos θ + 1=0 \)

980_concept_1,concept,980,"# Solving Trigonometric Equations with Multiple Angles

Sometimes it is not possible to solve a trigonometric equation with identities that have a multiple angle, such as \[\sin(2x)\] or \[\cos(3x).\] When confronted with these equations, recall that \[y=\sin(2x)\] is a horizontal compression by a factor of 2 of the function \[y=\sin x.\] On an interval of \[2\pi,\] we can graph two periods of \[y=\sin(2x),\] as opposed to one cycle of \[y=\sin x.\] This compression of the graph leads us to believe there may be twice as many \[x\]-intercepts or solutions to \[\sin(2x)=0\] compared to \[\sin x=0.\] This information will help us solve the equation.

# Example 17 Solving a Multiple Angle Trigonometric Equation

Solve exactly: \[\cos(2x) = \frac{1}{2}\] on \[0, 2π).\]

# Solution:

We can see that this equation is the standard equation with a multiple of an angle. If \[\cos(α) = \frac{1}{2}\], we know \[α\] is in quadrants I and IV. While \[θ = cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})\] will only yield solutions in quadrants I and II, we recognize that the solutions to the equation \[\cos(θ) = \frac{1}{2}\] will be in quadrants I and IV.

Therefore, the possible angles are \[θ = \frac{π}{3}\] and \[θ = \frac{5π}{3}\]. So, \[2x = \frac{π}{3}\] or \[2x = \frac{5π}{3}\], which means that \[x = \frac{π}{6}\] or \[x = \frac{5π}{6}\]. Does this make sense? Yes, because \[\cos(2(\frac{π}{6})) = \cos(\frac{π}{3}) = \frac{1}{2}\].

Are there any other possible answers? Let us return to our first step.

In quadrant I, \[2x = \frac{π}{3}\], so \[x = \frac{π}{6}\] as noted. Let us revolve around the circle again:

\[
2x = \frac{π}{3} + 2π
    = \frac{π}{3} + \frac{6π}{3}
    = \frac{7π}{3}
\]

so \[x = \frac{7π}{6}\].

One more rotation yields

\[
2x = \frac{π}{3} + 4π
    = \frac{π}{3} + \frac{12π}{3}
    = \frac{13π}{3}
\]

\[x = \frac{13π}{6} > 2π\], so this value for \[x\] is larger than \[2π\], so it is not a solution on \[[0, 2π)\].

In quadrant IV, \[2x = \frac{5π}{3}\], so \[x = \frac{5π}{6}\] as noted. Let us revolve around the circle again:

\[
2x = \frac{5π}{3} + 2π
    = \frac{5π}{3} + \frac{6π}{3}
    = \frac{11π}{3}
\]

so \[x = \frac{11π}{6}\].

One more rotation yields

\[
2x = \frac{5π}{3} + 4π
    = \frac{5π}{3} + \frac{12π}{3}
    = \frac{17π}{3}
\]

\[x = \frac{17π}{6} > 2π\], so this value for \[x\] is larger than \[2π\], so it is not a solution on \[[0, 2π)\].

Our solutions are \[\frac{π}{6}, \frac{5π}{6}, \frac{7π}{6}\], and \[\frac{11π}{6}\].

981_concept_1,concept,981,"# Solving Right Triangle Problems

We can now use all of the methods we have learned to solve problems that involve applying the properties of right triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem. We begin with the familiar Pythagorean Theorem, \[a^2 + b^2 = c^2,\] and model an equation to fit a situation.

# Example 18

# Using the Pythagorean Theorem to Model an Equation

Use the Pythagorean Theorem, and the properties of right triangles to model an equation that fits the problem.

One of the cables that anchors the center of the London Eye Ferris wheel to the ground must be replaced. The center of the Ferris wheel is 69.5 meters above the ground, and the second anchor on the ground is 23 meters from the base of the Ferris wheel. Approximately how long is the cable, and what is the angle of elevation (from ground up to the center of the Ferris wheel)? See Figure 4.



Figure 4

# Solution:

Using the information given, we can draw a right triangle. We can find the length of the cable with the Pythagorean Theorem.

\[
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
(23)^2 + (69.5)^2 &\approx 5359 \\
\sqrt{5359} &\approx 73.2 \text{ m}
\end{align*}
\]

The angle of elevation is \(\theta\), formed by the second anchor on the ground and the cable reaching to the center of the wheel. We can use the tangent function to find its measure. Round to two decimal places.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\tan \theta = \frac{69.5}{23} \\
\\
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{69.5}{23}\right) &\approx 1.2522 \\
\\
&\approx 71.69^{\circ}
\end{array}
\]

The angle of elevation is approximately \(71.7^{\circ}\), and the length of the cable is 73.2 meters.

# Example 19

# Using the Pythagorean Theorem to Model an Abstract Problem

OSHA safety regulations require that the base of a ladder be placed 1 foot from the wall for every 4 feet of ladder length. Find the angle that a ladder of any length forms with the ground and the height at which the ladder touches the wall.

# Solution:

For any length of ladder, the base needs to be a distance from the wall equal to one fourth of the ladder’s length. Equivalently, if the base of the ladder is “\[a\]” feet from the wall, the length of the ladder will be 4\[a\] feet. See Figure 5.



Figure 5

The side adjacent to \[\theta\] is \[a\] and the hypotenuse is \[4a\]. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{a}{4a} = \frac{1}{4} \\
\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) &\approx 75.5^{\circ}
\end{align*}
\]

The elevation of the ladder forms an angle of \[75.5^{\circ}\] with the ground. The height at which the ladder touches the wall can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem:

\[
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 &= (4a)^2 \\
b^2 &= (4a)^2 - a^2 \\
b^2 &= 16a^2 - a^2 \\
b^2 &= 15a^2 \\
b &= \sqrt{15}a
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the ladder touches the wall at \[\sqrt{15}a\] feet from the ground.

Suppose we charted the average daily temperatures in New York City over the course of one year. We would expect to find the lowest temperatures in January and February and highest in July and August. This familiar cycle repeats year after year, and if we were to extend the graph over multiple years, it would resemble a periodic function.

Many other natural phenomena are also periodic. For example, the phases of the moon have a period of approximately 28 days, and birds know to fly south at about the same time each year.

So how can we model an equation to reflect periodic behavior? First, we must collect and record data. We then find a function that resembles an observed pattern. Finally, we make the necessary alterations to the function to get a model that is dependable. In this section, we will take a deeper look at specific types of periodic behavior and model equations to fit data.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/685d05d4157e74d8a127d126db0c3087926f0218""]",Precalculus 2e,Modeling with Trigonometric Functions,Modeling with Trigonometric Functions,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
983_concept_1,concept,983,"# Determining the Amplitude and Period of a Sinusoidal Function

Any motion that repeats itself in a fixed time period is considered periodic motion and can be modeled by a sinusoidal function. The amplitude of a sinusoidal function is the distance from the midline to the maximum value, or from the midline to the minimum value. The midline is the average value. Sinusoidal functions oscillate above and below the midline, are periodic, and repeat values in set cycles. Recall from Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions that the period of the sine function and the cosine function is \[2\pi\]. In other words, for any value of \[x\],

\[\sin(x \pm 2\pi k) = \sin x\]    and  \[\cos(x \pm 2\pi k) = \cos x\] where \[k\] is an integer

### Standard Form of Sinusoidal Equations

The general forms of a sinusoidal equation are given as

\[
y = A \sin(Bt - C) + D \text{ or } y = A \cos(Bt - C) + D
\]

where amplitude = |A|, B is related to period such that the period = \(\frac{2\pi}{B}\), C is the phase shift such that \(\frac{C}{B}\) denotes the horizontal shift, and D represents the vertical shift from the graph’s parent graph.

Note that the models are sometimes written as 

\[
y = a \sin(\omega t \pm C) + D
\]

or 

\[
y = a \cos(\omega t \pm C) + D,
\]

and period is given as \(\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\).

The difference between the sine and the cosine graphs is that the sine graph begins with the average value of the function and the cosine graph begins with the maximum or minimum value of the function.

(d) The graph displays a horizontal shift equal to \[\frac{C}{B},\] or \[\frac{\frac{π}{2}}{4} = \frac{π}{8}.\] (e) Finally, the graph is shifted vertically by the value of \[D.\] In this case, the graph is shifted up by 2 units.

2. ⓑ \[y = -3 \sin\left(2x + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\]
3. ⓒ \[y = \cos(x) + 3\]

# Solution:

We will solve these problems according to the models.

1. ⓐ \[y = 2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{4}x\right)\] involves sine, so we use the form \[y = A \sin(Bt + C) + D\]. We know that \[|A|\] is the amplitude, so the amplitude is 2. Period is \[\frac{2\pi}{B}\], so the period is

\[
\frac{2\pi}{B} = \frac{2\pi}{\frac{1}{4}} = 8\pi
\]

See the graph in Figure 3.



Figure 3

2. ⓑ \[y = -3 \sin(2x + \frac{\pi}{2})\] involves sine, so we use the form \[y = A \sin(Bt - C) + D\]. Amplitude is \[|A|\], so the amplitude is \[|-3| = 3\]. Since A is negative, the graph is reflected over the x-axis. Period is \[\frac{2\pi}{B}\], so the period is

\[
\frac{2\pi}{B} = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi
\]

The graph is shifted to the left by \[\frac{C}{B} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}\] units. See Figure 4.



Figure 4

3. ⓒ \[y = \cos x + 3\] involves cosine, so we use the form \[y = A \cos(Bt \pm C) + D\]. Amplitude is \[|A|\], so the amplitude is 1. The period is \(2\pi\). See Figure 5. This is the standard cosine function shifted up three units.

One method of graphing sinusoidal functions is to find five key points. These points will correspond to intervals of equal length representing \[\frac{1}{4}\] of the period. The key points will indicate the location of maximum and minimum values. If there is no vertical shift, they will also indicate \[x\]-intercepts. For example, suppose we want to graph the function \[y = cos \theta.\] We know that the period is \[2\pi,\] so we find the interval between key points as follows.

\[\frac{2\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}\]

Starting with \[\theta = 0,\] we calculate the first \[y\]-value, add the length of the interval \[\frac{\pi}{2}\] to 0, and calculate the second \[y\]-value. We then add \[\frac{\pi}{2}\] repeatedly until the five key points are determined. The last value should equal the first value, as the calculations cover one full period. Making a table similar to Table 1, we can see these key points clearly on the graph shown in Figure 6.

The average monthly temperatures for a small town in Oregon are given in Table 3. Find a sinusoidal function of the form \[y = A \sin(Bt - C) + D\] that fits the data (round to the nearest tenth) and sketch the graph.

| Month | Temperature, °F |

| August | 69 |
| September | 64.5 |
| October | 55.5 |
| November | 46.5 |
| December | 43.5 |

Table 3

# Solution:

Recall that amplitude is found using the formula

\[
A = \frac{{\text{{largest value}} - \text{{smallest value}}}}{2}
\]

Thus, the amplitude is

\[
\begin{align*}
|A| &= \frac{{69 - 42.5}}{2} \\
&= 13.25
\end{align*}
\]

The data covers a period of 12 months, so \(\frac{{2\pi}}{B} = 12\) which gives \(B = \frac{{2\pi}}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6}\).

The vertical shift is found using the following equation.

\[
D = \frac{{\text{{highest value}} + \text{{lowest value}}}}{2}
\]

Thus, the vertical shift is

\[
\begin{align*}
D &= \frac{{69 + 42.5}}{2} \\
&= 55.8
\end{align*}
\]

So far, we have the equation \(y = 13.3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}x - C\right) + 55.8\).

To find the horizontal shift, we input the \(x\) and \(y\) values for the first month and solve for \(C\).

\[
\begin{align*}
42.5 &= 13.3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}(1) - C\right) + 55.8 \\
-13.3 &= 13.3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - C\right) \\
-1 &= \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - C\right) & \text{{where }} \sin\theta = -1 \rightarrow \theta = -\frac{\pi}{2} \\
\frac{\pi}{6} - C &= -\frac{\pi}{2} \\
\frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{2} &= C \\
&= \frac{2\pi}{3}
\end{align*}
\]

We have the equation \(y = 13.3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}x - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + 55.8\). See the graph in Figure 8.

# Example 5 Describing Periodic Motion

The hour hand of the large clock on the wall in Union Station measures 24 inches in length. At noon, the tip of the hour hand is 30 inches from the ceiling. At 3 PM, the tip is 54 inches from the ceiling, and at 6 PM, 78 inches. At 9 PM, it is again 54 inches from the ceiling, and at midnight, the tip of the hour hand returns to its original position 30 inches from the ceiling. Let \[y\] equal the distance from the tip of the hour hand to the ceiling \[x\] hours after noon. Find the equation that models the motion of the clock and sketch the graph.

# Solution:

Begin by making a table of values as shown in Table 4.

| x | y | Points to plot |
|---|---|----------------|
| Noon | 30 in | \[(0,30)\] |
| 3 PM | 54 in | \[(3,54)\] |
| 6 PM | 78 in | \[(6,78)\] |
| 9 PM | 54 in | \[(9,54)\] |
| Midnight | 30 in | \[(12,30)\] |

Table 4

To model an equation, we first need to find the amplitude.

\[
\begin{align*}
|A| &= \left|\frac{78-30}{2}\right| \\
&= 24
\end{align*}
\]

The clock’s cycle repeats every 12 hours. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
B &= \frac{2\pi}{12} \\
&= \frac{\pi}{6}
\end{align*}
\]

The vertical shift is

\[
\begin{align*}
D &= \frac{78+30}{2} \\
&= 54
\end{align*}
\]

There is no horizontal shift, so \(C = 0.\) Since the function begins with the minimum value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\) (as opposed to the maximum value), we will use the cosine function with the negative value for \(A.\) In the form \(y = A \cos(Bx \pm C) + D,\) the equation is

\[
y = -24 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}x\right) + 54

# Example 6

# Determining a Model for Tides

The height of the tide in a small beach town is measured along a seawall. Water levels oscillate between 7 feet at low tide and 15 feet at high tide. On a particular day, low tide occurred at 6 AM and high tide occurred at noon. Approximately every 12 hours, the cycle repeats. Find an equation to model the water levels.

# Solution:

As the water level varies from 7 ft to 15 ft, we can calculate the amplitude as

\[
|A| = \left|\frac{(15 - 7)}{2}\right| = 4
\]

The cycle repeats every 12 hours; therefore, B is

\[
\frac{2\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

There is a vertical translation of 

\[
\frac{(15 + 7)}{2} = 11.5
\]

Since the value of the function is at a maximum at t = 0, we will use the cosine function, with the positive value for A.

\[
y = 4 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)t + 11
\]

See Figure 10.

# Interpreting the Periodic Behavior Equation

The average person’s blood pressure is modeled by the function \[f(t) = 20 \sin(160\pi t) + 100,\] where \[f(t)\] represents the blood pressure at time \[t,\] measured in minutes. Interpret the function in terms of period and frequency. Sketch the graph and find the blood pressure reading.

# Solution:

The period is given by

\[
\frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{160\pi} = \frac{1}{80}
\]

In a blood pressure function, frequency represents the number of heart beats per minute. Frequency is the reciprocal of period and is given by

\[
\frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{160\pi}{2\pi} = 80
\]

See the graph in Figure 11.



Figure 11: The blood pressure reading on the graph is 

\[
\frac{120}{80} \quad \left(\frac{\text{maximum}}{\text{minimum}}\right).
\]

Analysis 

Blood pressure of \(\frac{120}{80}\) is considered to be normal. The top number is the maximum or systolic reading, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts. The bottom number is the minimum or diastolic reading, which measures the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes between beats, refilling with blood. Thus, normal blood pressure can be modeled by a periodic function with a maximum of 120 and a minimum of 80.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/00d62156cae20983543dbaf79572796dbb3f1628"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/ae8cc385e6ed68cae228434a5763ed47561eb5a4"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/a3cc5bbc4ce802edab8f7e294c300f74647c7306"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/0b161c08e02f509ceded67697c9abbd1295d534e""]",Precalculus 2e,Modeling Periodic Behavior,Modeling with Trigonometric Functions,Trigonometric Identities and Equations
986_concept_1,concept,986,"# Modeling Harmonic Motion Functions

Harmonic motion is a form of periodic motion, but there are factors to consider that differentiate the two types. While general periodic motion applications cycle through their periods with no outside interference, harmonic motion requires a restoring force. Examples of harmonic motion include springs, gravitational force, and magnetic force.

### Simple Harmonic Motion

A type of motion described as simple harmonic motion involves a restoring force but assumes that the motion will continue forever. Imagine a weighted object hanging on a spring, When that object is not disturbed, we say that the object is at rest, or in equilibrium. If the object is pulled down and then released, the force of the spring pulls the object back toward equilibrium and harmonic motion begins. The restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement of the object from its equilibrium point. When \[t = 0, d = 0.\]

### Simple Harmonic Motion

We see that simple harmonic motion equations are given in terms of displacement:

\[
d = a \cos(\omega t) \text{ or } d = a \sin(\omega t)
\]

where \(|a|\) is the amplitude, \(\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\) is the period, and \(\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\) is the frequency, or the number of cycles per unit of time.

   1. The maximum displacement is equal to the amplitude, \[|a|\], which is 5.
   2. The period is \[\frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{3}\].

# Damped Harmonic Motion

In reality, a pendulum does not swing back and forth forever, nor does an object on a spring bounce up and down forever. Eventually, the pendulum stops swinging and the object stops bouncing and both return to equilibrium. Periodic motion in which an energy-dissipating force, or damping factor, acts is known as damped harmonic motion. Friction is typically the damping factor.

In physics, various formulas are used to account for the damping factor on the moving object. Some of these are calculus-based formulas that involve derivatives. For our purposes, we will use formulas for basic damped harmonic motion models.

### Damped Harmonic Motion 

In \(\textbf{damped harmonic motion}\), the displacement of an oscillating object from its rest position at time \(t\) is given as

\[
f(t) = a e^{-ct} \sin(\omega t) \quad \text{or} \quad f(t) = a e^{-ct} \cos(\omega t)
\]

where \(c\) is a damping factor, \(|a|\) is the initial displacement and \(\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\) is the period.

#### Example 9 Modeling Damped Harmonic Motion

Model the equations that fit the two scenarios and use a graphing utility to graph the functions: Two mass-spring systems exhibit damped harmonic motion at a frequency of \[0.5\] cycles per second. Both have an initial displacement of 10 cm. The first has a damping factor of \[0.5\] and the second has a damping factor of \[0.1\].

# Solution:

At time \(t = 0\), the displacement is the maximum of 10 cm, which calls for the cosine function. The cosine function will apply to both models.

We are given the frequency \(f = \frac{ω}{2π}\) of 0.5 cycles per second. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{ω}{2π} &= 0.5 \\
ω &= (0.5)2π \\
&= π
\end{align*}
\]

The first spring system has a damping factor of \(c = 0.5.\) Following the general model for damped harmonic motion, we have

\[f(t) = 10e^{-0.5t}\cos(πt)\]

Figure 15 models the motion of the first spring system.


Figure 15
\
The second spring system has a damping factor of \(c = 0.1\) and can be modeled as

\[f(t) = 10e^{-0.1t}\cos(πt)\]

Figure 16 models the motion of the second spring system.


Figure 16

# Analysis

Notice the differing effects of the damping constant. The local maximum and minimum values of the function with the damping factor \(c = 0.5\) decreases much more rapidly than that of the function with \(c = 0.1.\)

#### Example 10

# Finding a Cosine Function that Models Damped Harmonic Motion

Find and graph a function of the form \[y = a e^{-ct} \cos(\omega t)\] that models the information given.

ⓐ \[a = 20, c = 0.05, p = 4\]
ⓑ \[a = 2, c = 1.5, f = 3\]

# Solution:

Substitute the given values into the model. Recall that period is \[\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\] and frequency is \[\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\].

ⓐ \[y = 20e^{-0.05t}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}t\right).\] See Figure 17.



Figure 17

ⓑ \[y = 2e^{-1.5t}\cos(6\pi t).\] See Figure 18.



Figure 18

#### Example 11

# Finding a Sine Function that Models Damped Harmonic Motion

Find and graph a function of the form \[y = a e^{-ct} \sin(\omega t)\] that models the information given.

ⓐ \[a = 7, c = 10, p = \frac{\pi}{6}\]
ⓑ \[a = 0.3, c = 0.2, f = 20\]

# Solution:

Calculate the value of \(\omega\) and substitute the known values into the model.

ⓐ As period is \(\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\), we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\pi}{6} &= \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \\
\omega\pi &= 6(2\pi) \\
\omega &= 12
\end{align*}
\]

The damping factor is given as 10 and the amplitude is 7. Thus, the model is \(y = 7e^{-10t}\sin(12t)\). See Figure 19.



Figure 19

ⓑ As frequency is \(\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\), we have

\[
\begin{align*}
20 &= \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \\
40\pi &= \omega
\end{align*}
\]

The damping factor is given as 0.2 and the amplitude is 0.3. The model is \(y = 0.3e^{-0.2t}\sin(40\pi t)\). See Figure 20.



Figure 20

# Analysis

A comparison of the last two examples illustrates how we choose between the sine or cosine functions to model sinusoidal criteria. We see that the cosine function is at the maximum displacement when \(t = 0\), and the sine function is at the equilibrium point when \(t = 0\). For example, consider the equation \(y = 20e^{-0.05t}\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}t)\) from Example 10. We can see from the graph that when \(t = 0, y = 20\), which is the initial amplitude. Check this by setting \(t = 0\) in the cosine equation:

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= 20e^{-0.05(0)}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)(0) \\
&= 20(1)(1) \\
&= 20
\end{align*}
\]

Using the sine function yields

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= 20e^{-0.05(0)}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)(0) \\
&= 20(1)(0) \\
&= 0
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, cosine is the correct function.

#### Example 12

# Modeling the Oscillation of a Spring

A spring measuring 10 inches in natural length is compressed by 5 inches and released. It oscillates once every 3 seconds, and its amplitude decreases by 30% every second. Find an equation that models the position of the spring \[t\] seconds after being released.

# Solution:

The amplitude begins at 5 in. and deceases 30% each second. Because the spring is initially compressed, we will write A as a negative value. We can write the amplitude portion of the function as

\[A(t) = 5(1 - 0.30)^t\]

We put \[(1 - 0.30)^t\] in the form \[e^{ct}\] as follows:


0.7 = \(e^c\)
c = ln.7
c = -0.357

Now let’s address the period. The spring cycles through its positions every 3 seconds, this is the period, and we can use the formula to find omega.


3 = \[\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\]
\[\omega = \frac{2\pi}{3}\]

The natural length of 10 inches is the midline. We will use the cosine function, since the spring starts out at its maximum displacement. This portion of the equation is represented as

\[y = \cos(\frac{2\pi}{3}t) + 10\]

Finally, we put both functions together. Our the model for the position of the spring at t seconds is given as

\[y = -5e^{-0.357t}\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3}t) + 10\]

See the graph in Figure 21.



Figure 21

#### Example 13

# Finding the Value of the Damping Constant c According to the Given Criteria

A guitar string is plucked and vibrates in damped harmonic motion. The string is pulled and displaced 2 cm from its resting position. After 3 seconds, the displacement of the string measures 1 cm. Find the damping constant.

# Solution:

The displacement factor represents the amplitude and is determined by the coefficient \[a e^{-ct}\] in the model for damped harmonic motion. The damping constant is included in the term \[e^{-ct}.\] It is known that after 3 seconds, the local maximum measures one-half of its original value. Therefore, we have the equation

\[
a e^{-c(t+3)} = \frac{1}{2} a e^{-ct}
\]

Use algebra and the laws of exponents to solve for \[c.\]

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
a e^{-c(t+3)} = \frac{1}{2} a e^{-ct} \\
e^{-ct} \cdot e^{-3c} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-ct}  &\text{ Divide out a.} \\
e^{-3c} = \frac{1}{2} &\text{ Divide out } e^{-ct}\ \\
e^{3c} = 2&\text{Take reciprocals.} \\
 \end{array}
 \]
Then use the laws of logarithms.


\[e^{3c} = 2\] 
\[3c = \ln(2)\] 
\[c = \frac{\ln(2)}{3}\] 

The damping constant is \[\frac{\ln(2)}{3}.\]

### Bounding Curves in Harmonic Motion

Harmonic motion graphs may be enclosed by bounding curves. When a function has a varying amplitude, such that the amplitude rises and falls multiple times within a period, we can determine the bounding curves from part of the function.

#### Example 14

# Graphing an Oscillating Cosine Curve

Graph the function \[f(x) = \cos(2πx)\cos(16πx).\]

# Solution:

The graph produced by this function will be shown in two parts. The first graph will be the exact function \[f(x)\] (see Figure 22), and the second graph is the exact function \[f(x)\] plus a bounding function (see Figure 23). The graphs look quite different.



Figure 22



Figure 23

# Analysis

The curves \[y = \cos(2πx)\] and \[y = -\cos(2πx)\] are bounding curves: they bound the function from above and below, tracing out the high and low points. The harmonic motion graph sits inside the bounding curves. This is an example of a function whose amplitude not only decreases with time, but actually increases and decreases multiple times within a period.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/3cca1417932e02f36c66b3b8476a5158ac24db3c"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/c9be787b679b76aa12ec247ef63bc63fe5a17e74"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/8ed82ebd7fb5408336c59766de09a86934991913"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/5958033b9ab37a4504217cb9752081ae817b062a"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/2ca4e6f48fce47b8ba826143c8dc99e8cd722314"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/4dcb830fd97ec4213cce4e354a1d6aaedf1ff6b0"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/c8810d4e9530a2c2635042d6377fa00a7650561d"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/bcfad1bd1d0f413cf9f0079d160cec70eeb6c80f"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/5233d7b1e80e9600205740583af67ec4ca16de89"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/256bf28b5f383efbe6ef37e9824e7a0a9e813ece"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/a07761f5a5f457442d245fb91c4952acc59d29c2"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/226da83a7a3bd42c756028f626907cb2d660bfe7""]",Precalculus 2e,Modeling Harmonic Motion Functions,Modeling with Trigonometric Functions,Trigonometric Identities and Equations

# Non-right Triangles: Law of Sines

### Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:

- Use the Law of Sines to solve oblique triangles.
- Find the area of an oblique triangle using the sine function.
- Solve applied problems using the Law of Sines.

To ensure the safety of over 5,000 U.S. aircraft flying simultaneously during peak times, air traffic controllers monitor and communicate with them after receiving data from the robust radar beacon system. Suppose two radar stations located 20 miles apart each detect an aircraft between them. The angle of elevation measured by the first station is 35 degrees, whereas the angle of elevation measured by the second station is 15 degrees. How can we determine the altitude of the aircraft? We see in Figure 1 that the triangle formed by the aircraft and the two stations is not a right triangle, so we cannot use what we know about right triangles. In this section, we will find out how to solve problems involving non-right triangles.



Figure 1","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/05122d1a3debb27e1d298d9d1b30ae191a38bfaa""]",Precalculus 2e,Non-right Triangles: Law of Sines,Non-right Triangles: Law of Sines,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1035_concept_1,concept,1035,"# Using the Law of Sines to Solve Oblique Triangles

In any triangle, we can draw an altitude, a perpendicular line from one vertex to the opposite side, forming two right triangles. It would be preferable, however, to have methods that we can apply directly to non-right triangles without first having to create right triangles.

Any triangle that is not a right triangle is an oblique triangle. Solving an oblique triangle means finding the measurements of all three angles and all three sides. To do so, we need to start with at least three of these values, including at least one of the sides. We will investigate three possible oblique triangle problem situations:

1. ASA (angle-side-angle) We know the measurements of two angles and the included side. See Figure 2.

    

    Figure 2

2. AAS (angle-angle-side) We know the measurements of two angles and a side that is not between the known angles. See Figure 3.

    

    Figure 3

3. SSA (side-side-angle) We know the measurements of two sides and an angle that is not between the known sides. See Figure 4.

    

    Figure 4

Knowing how to approach each of these situations enables us to solve oblique triangles without having to drop a perpendicular to form two right triangles. Instead, we can use the fact that the ratio of the measurement of one of the angles to the length of its opposite side will be equal to the other two ratios of angle measure to opposite side. Let’s see how this statement is derived by considering the triangle shown in Figure 5.



Figure 5

Using the right triangle relationships, we know that \[\sin \alpha = \frac{h}{b}\] and \[\sin \beta = \frac{h}{a}.\] Solving both equations for \(h\) gives two different expressions for \(h\).

\[
h = b \sin \alpha \text{ and } h = a \sin \beta
\]

We then set the expressions equal to each other.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
b\sin\alpha = a\sin\beta & \\
\\
\left(\frac{1}{ab}\right)(b\sin\alpha) = \left(\frac{1}{ab}\right)(a\sin\beta) & \text{Multiply both sides by } \frac{1}{ab}. \\
\\
\frac{\sin\alpha}{a} = \frac{\sin\beta}{b} & \\
\end{array}
\]

Similarly, we can compare the other ratios.

\[\frac{\sin \alpha}{a} = \frac{\sin \gamma}{c}\] and \[\frac{\sin \beta}{b} = \frac{\sin \gamma}{c}\]

Collectively, these relationships are called the Law of Sines.

\[
\frac{\sin \alpha}{a} = \frac{\sin \beta}{b} = \frac{\sin \gamma}{c}
\]

Note the standard way of labeling triangles: angle \[\alpha\] (alpha) is opposite side \[a;\] angle \[\beta\] (beta) is opposite side \[b;\] and angle \[\gamma\] (gamma) is opposite side \[c.\] See Figure 6.

While calculating angles and sides, be sure to carry the exact values through to the final answer. Generally, final answers are rounded to the nearest tenth, unless otherwise specified.



Figure 6

### Law of Sines

Given a triangle with angles and opposite sides labeled as in Figure 6, the ratio of the measurement of an angle to the length of its opposite side will be equal to the other two ratios of angle measure to opposite side. All proportions will be equal. The Law of Sines is based on proportions and is presented symbolically two ways.

\[
\frac{\sin \alpha}{a} = \frac{\sin \beta}{b} = \frac{\sin \gamma}{c}
\]

\[
\frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma}
\]

To solve an oblique triangle, use any pair of applicable ratios.

# Example 1

# Solving for Two Unknown Sides and Angle of an AAS Triangle
Solve the triangle shown in Figure 7 to the nearest tenth.



Figure 7

# Solution:

The three angles must add up to 180 degrees. From this, we can determine that 

\[
\begin{align*}
β &= 180° - 50° - 30° \\
&= 100°
\end{align*}
\]

To find an unknown side, we need to know the corresponding angle and a known ratio. We know that angle \(α = 50°\) and its corresponding side \(a = 10.\) We can use the following proportion from the Law of Sines to find the length of \(c.\)

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin(50°)}{10} &= \frac{\sin(30°)}{c} \\
c \frac{\sin(50°)}{10} &= \sin(30°) \quad &\text{Multiply both sides by } c. \\
c &= \frac{10 \sin(30°)}{\sin(50°)} \quad &\text{Multiply by the reciprocal to isolate } c. \\
c &≈ 6.5
\end{align*}
\]

Similarly, to solve for \(b,\) we set up another proportion.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin(50°)}{10} &= \frac{\sin(100°)}{b} \\
b \sin(50°) &= 10 \sin(100°) \quad \text{Multiply both sides by } b. \\
b &= \frac{10 \sin(100°)}{\sin(50°)} \quad \text{Multiply by the reciprocal to isolate } b. \\
b &≈ 12.9
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the complete set of angles and sides is

\[
\begin{align*}
α = 50° &&&&&&&& a = 10 \\
β = 100°&&&&&&&& b ≈ 12.9 \\
γ = 30° &&&&&&&& c ≈ 6.5

In some cases, more than one triangle may satisfy the given criteria, which we describe as an ambiguous case. Triangles classified as SSA, those in which we know the lengths of two sides and the measurement of the angle opposite one of the given sides, may result in one or two solutions, or even no solution.

### Possible Outcomes for SSA Triangles

Oblique triangles in the category SSA may have four different outcomes. Figure 9 illustrates the solutions with the known sides \(a\) and \(b\) and known angle \(α.\)



Figure 9

# Example 2

# Solving an Oblique SSA Triangle
Solve the triangle in Figure 10 for the missing side and find the missing angle measures to the nearest tenth.



Figure 10

# Solution:

Use the Law of Sines to find angle \(\beta\) and angle \(\gamma\), and then side \(c\). Solving for \(\beta\), we have the proportion

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin\alpha}{a} &= \frac{\sin\beta}{b} \\
\frac{\sin(35°)}{6} &= \frac{\sin\beta}{8} \\
\frac{8\sin(35°)}{6} &= \sin\beta \\
0.7648 &\approx \sin\beta \\
\sin^{-1}(0.7648) &\approx 49.9° \\
\beta &\approx 49.9°
\end{align*}
\]

However, in the diagram, angle \(\beta\) appears to be an obtuse angle and may be greater than 90°. How did we get an acute angle, and how do we find the measurement of \(\beta\)? Let’s investigate further. Dropping a perpendicular from \(\gamma\) and viewing the triangle from a right angle perspective, we have Figure 11. It appears that there may be a second triangle that will fit the given criteria.



The angle supplementary to \(\beta\) is approximately equal to 49.9°, which means that \(\beta = 180° - 49.9° = 130.1°\). (Remember that the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants.) Solving for \(\gamma\),  we have

\[
\gamma = 180° - 35° - 130.1° \approx 14.9°
\]

We can then use these measurements to solve the other triangle. Since \(\gamma'\) is supplementary to the sum of \(\alpha'\) and \(\beta'\),  we have

\[
\gamma' = 180° - 35° - 49.9° \approx 95.1°
\]

Now we need to find \(c\) and \(c'\).

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{c}{\sin(14.9°)} &= \frac{6}{\sin(35°)} \\
c &= \frac{6\sin(14.9°)}{\sin(35°)} \approx 2.7
\end{align*}
\]

Finally,

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{c'}{\sin(95.1°)} &= \frac{6}{\sin(35°)} \\
c' &= \frac{6\sin(95.1°)}{\sin(35°)} \approx 10.4
\end{align*}
\]

To summarize, there are two triangles with an angle of 35°, an adjacent side of 8, and an opposite side of 6, as shown in Figure 12.



However, we were looking for the values for the triangle with an obtuse angle \(\beta\). We can see them in the first triangle (a) in Figure 12.

# Example 3

# Solving for the Unknown Sides and Angles of a SSA Triangle
In the triangle shown in Figure 13, solve for the unknown side and angles. Round your answers to the nearest tenth.



Figure 13

# Solution:

In choosing the pair of ratios from the Law of Sines to use, look at the information given. In this case, we know the angle \[\gamma = 85°,\] and its corresponding side \[c = 12,\] and we know side \[b = 9.\] We will use this proportion to solve for \[\beta.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin(85°)}{12} &= \frac{\sin \beta}{9} & \text{Isolate the unknown.} \\
\frac{9 \sin(85°)}{12} &= sin \beta
\end{align*}
\]

To find \[\beta,\] apply the inverse sine function. The inverse sine will produce a single result, but keep in mind that there may be two values for \[\beta.\] It is important to verify the result, as there may be two viable solutions, only one solution (the usual case), or no solutions.

\[
\begin{align*}
\beta &= \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{9 \sin(85°)}{12}\right) \\
\beta &\approx \sin^{-1}(0.7471) \\
\beta &\approx 48.3°
\end{align*}
\]

In this case, if we subtract \[\beta\] from 180°, we find that there may be a second possible solution. Thus, \[\beta = 180° - 48.3° \approx 131.7°.\] To check the solution, subtract both angles, 131.7° and 85°, from 180°. This gives \[\alpha = 180° - 85° - 131.7° \approx -36.7°,\] which is impossible, and so \[\beta \approx 48.3°.\]

To find the remaining missing values, we calculate \[\alpha = 180° - 85° - 48.3° \approx 46.7°.\] Now, only side \[a\] is needed. Use the Law of Sines to solve for \[a\] by one of the proportions.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin(85°)}{12} &= \frac{\sin(46.7°)}{a} \\
a \frac{\sin(85°)}{12} &= \sin(46.7°) \\
a &= \frac{12 \sin(46.7°)}{\sin(85°)} \approx 8.8
\end{align*}
\]

The complete set of solutions for the given triangle is

\[
\begin{align*}
\alpha \approx 46.7° & \quad a \approx 8.8 \\
\beta \approx 48.3° & \quad b = 9 \\
\gamma = 85° & \quad c = 12
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 4

# Finding the Triangles That Meet the Given Criteria
Find all possible triangles if one side has length 4 opposite an angle of 50°, and a second side has length 10.

# Solution:

Using the given information, we can solve for the angle opposite the side of length 10. See Figure 14.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin\alpha}{10} &= \frac{\sin(50°)}{4} \\
\sin\alpha &= \frac{10\sin(50°)}{4} \\
\sin\alpha &\approx 1.915
\end{align*}
\]



Figure 14

We can stop here without finding the value of \(\alpha\). Because the range of the sine function is \([-1,1]\), it is impossible for the sine value to be 1.915. In fact, inputting \(\sin^{-1}(1.915)\) in a graphing calculator generates an ERROR DOMAIN. Therefore, no triangles can be drawn with the provided dimensions.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/958cbd131ccce608b79c541468c5c44877cae366"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/6df137b4b734f1ed3b9d6fd6602fdba58346dc2c"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/82864774e0331defc63144cbc9c6857d1a1cc922"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/78d767d95b8074262a5113373a73be73644915f1"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/2e51f5df2cb26032df01e2e48dc0ef6f0aefdce7"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/54f36676920b983215f2a5b5e8486d4ab2de82f6""]",Precalculus 2e,Using The Law of Sines to Solve SSA Triangles,Non-right Triangles: Law of Sines,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1037_concept_1,concept,1037,"#  Finding the Area of an Oblique Triangle Using the Sine Function

Now that we can solve a triangle for missing values, we can use some of those values and the sine function to find the area of an oblique triangle. Recall that the area formula for a triangle is given as \[Area = \frac{1}{2}bh,\] where \[b\] is base and \[h\] is height. For oblique triangles, we must find \[h\] before we can use the area formula. Observing the two triangles in Figure 15, one acute and one obtuse, we can drop a perpendicular to represent the height and then apply the trigonometric property \[\sin α = \frac{\text{Popposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\] to write an equation for area in oblique triangles. In the acute triangle, we have \[\sin α = \frac{h}{c}\] or \[c \sin α = h.\] However, in the obtuse triangle, we drop the perpendicular outside the triangle and extend the base \[b\] to form a right triangle. The angle used in calculation is \[α',\] or \[180 - α.\]



Figure 15

Thus,

\[Area = \frac{1}{2}\text{(base)}\text{(height)} = \frac{1}{2}b(c\sin\alpha)\]

Similarly,

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}a(b\sin\gamma) = \frac{1}{2}a(c\sin\beta)
\]

### Area of an Oblique Triangle

The formula for the area of an oblique triangle is given by

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Area} &= \frac{1}{2}bc\sin\alpha \\
&= \frac{1}{2}ac\sin\beta \\
&= \frac{1}{2}ab\sin\gamma \\
\end{align*}
\]

This is equivalent to one-half of the product of two sides and the sine of their included angle.

The more we study trigonometric applications, the more we discover that the applications are countless. Some are flat, diagram-type situations, but many applications in calculus, engineering, and physics involve three dimensions and motion.

# Example 6

### Finding an Altitude
Find the altitude of the aircraft in the problem introduced at the beginning of this section, shown in Figure 16. Round the altitude to the nearest tenth of a mile.



Figure 16

# Solution:

To find the elevation of the aircraft, we first find the distance from one station to the aircraft, such as the side \(a,\) and then use right triangle relationships to find the height of the aircraft, \(h.\)

Because the angles in the triangle add up to 180 degrees, the unknown angle must be 180°−15°−35°=130°. This angle is opposite the side of length 20, allowing us to set up a Law of Sines relationship.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin(130°)}{20} &= \frac{\sin(35°)}{a} \\
a\sin(130°) &= 20\sin(35°) \\
a &= \frac{20\sin(35°)}{\sin(130°)} \\
a &\approx 14.98
\end{align*}
\]

The distance from one station to the aircraft is about 14.98 miles.

Now that we know \(a,\) we can use right triangle relationships to solve for \(h.\)

\[
\begin{align*}
\sin(15°) &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \\
\sin(15°) &= \frac{h}{a} \\
\sin(15°) &= \frac{h}{14.98} \\
h &= 14.98\sin(15°) \\
h &\approx 3.88
\end{align*}
\]

The aircraft is at an altitude of approximately 3.9 miles.

In this section, you will:

- Use the Law of Cosines to solve oblique triangles.
- Solve applied problems using the Law of Cosines.
- Use Heron’s formula to ﬁnd the area of a triangle.

Suppose a boat leaves port, travels 10 miles, turns 20 degrees, and travels another 8 miles as shown in Figure 1. How far from port is the boat?



Figure 1

Unfortunately, while the Law of Sines enables us to address many non-right triangle cases, it does not help us with triangles where the known angle is between two known sides, a SAS (side-angle-side) triangle, or when all three sides are known, but no angles are known, a SSS (side-side-side) triangle. In this section, we will investigate another tool for solving oblique triangles described by these last two cases.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/3d31f961249b817377fc4e2c763623195e33a41e""]",Precalculus 2e,Non-right Triangles: Law of Cosines,Non-right Triangles: Law of Cosines,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1040_concept_1,concept,1040,"# Using the Law of Cosines to Solve Oblique Triangles

The tool we need to solve the problem of the boat’s distance from the port is the **Law of Cosines**, which defines the relationship among angle measurements and side lengths in oblique triangles. Three formulas make up the Law of Cosines. At first glance, the formulas may appear complicated because they include many variables. However, once the pattern is understood, the Law of Cosines is easier to work with than most formulas at this mathematical level.

Understanding how the Law of Cosines is derived will be helpful in using the formulas. The derivation begins with the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem, which is an extension of the Pythagorean Theorem to non-right triangles. Here is how it works: An arbitrary non-right triangle \[ABC\] is placed in the coordinate plane with vertex \[A\] at the origin, side \[c\] drawn along the x-axis, and vertex \[C\] located at some point \[(x, y)\] in the plane, as illustrated in Figure 2. Generally, triangles exist anywhere in the plane, but for this explanation we will place the triangle as noted.



Figure 2

We can drop a perpendicular from \[C\] to the \[x\]-axis (this is the altitude or height). Recalling the basic trigonometric identities, we know that

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{x \text{(adjacent)}}{b \text{(hypotenuse)}} \text{ and } \sin \theta = \frac{y \text{(opposite)}}{b \text{(hypotenuse)}}
\]

In terms of \[θ, x = b \cos θ\] and \[y = b \sin θ.\] The \[(x, y)\] point located at \[C\] has coordinates \[(b \cos θ,\] \[b \sin θ).\] Using the side \[(x−c)\] as one leg of a right triangle and \[y\] as the second leg, we can find the length of hypotenuse \[a\] using the Pythagorean Theorem. Thus,

\[
\begin{array}{llllll}
a^2 &= (x - c)^2 + y^2 & & & & & \\
&= (b \cos \theta - c)^2 + (b \sin \theta)^2 & & & & & \text{Substitute } b \cos \theta \text{ for } x \text{ and } b \sin \theta \text{ for } y. \\
&= (b^2 \cos^2 \theta - 2bc \cos \theta + c^2) + b^2 \sin^2 \theta & & & & & \text{Expand the perfect square.} \\
&= b^2 \cos^2 \theta + b^2 \sin^2 \theta + c^2 - 2bc \cos \theta & & & & & \text{Group terms noting that } \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1. \\
&= b^2 (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) + c^2 - 2bc \cos \theta & & & & & \text{Factor out } b^2. \\
a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \theta & & & & & \\
\end{array}
\]

The formula derived is one of the three equations of the Law of Cosines. The other equations are found in a similar fashion.

Keep in mind that it is always helpful to sketch the triangle when solving for angles or sides. In a real-world scenario, try to draw a diagram of the situation. As more information emerges, the diagram may have to be altered. Make those alterations to the diagram and, in the end, the problem will be easier to solve.

### Law of Cosines

The Law of Cosines states that the square of any side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of the other two sides and the cosine of the included angle. For triangles labeled as in Figure 3, with angles \(\alpha, \beta,\) and \(\gamma,\) and opposite corresponding sides \(a, b,\) and \(c\) respectively, the Law of Cosines is given as three equations.

\[
\begin{align*}
a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha \\
b^2 &= a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos \beta \\
c^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma
\end{align*}
\]



Figure 3

To solve for a missing side measurement, the corresponding opposite angle measure is needed.

When solving for an angle, the corresponding opposite side measure is needed. We can use another version of the Law of Cosines to solve for an angle.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \alpha &= \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \\
\cos \beta &= \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} \\
\cos \gamma &= \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
\end{align*}
\]

# How To

**Given two sides and the angle between them (SAS), find the measures of the remaining side and angles of a triangle.**

1. Sketch the triangle. Identify the measures of the known sides and angles. Use variables to represent the measures of the unknown sides and angles.
2. Apply the Law of Cosines to find the length of the unknown side or angle.
3. Apply the Law of Sines or Cosines to find the measure of a second angle.
4. Compute the measure of the remaining angle.

# Example 1

# Finding the Unknown Side and Angles of a SAS Triangle 

Find the unknown side and angles of the triangle in Figure 4.



Figure 4

# Solution:

First, make note of what is given: two sides and the angle between them. This arrangement is classified as SAS and supplies the data needed to apply the Law of Cosines. 

Each one of the three laws of cosines begins with the square of an unknown side opposite a known angle. For this example, the first side to solve for is side \(b,\) as we know the measurement of the opposite angle \(β.\)

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos β & \\
b^2 = 10^2 + 12^2 - 2(10)(12) \cos (30°) & \text{Substitute the measurements for the known quantities.} \\
b^2 = 100 + 144 - 240 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) & \text{Evaluate the cosine and begin to simplify.} \\
b^2 = 244 - 120\sqrt{3} & \\
b = \sqrt{244 - 120\sqrt{3}} & \text{Use the square root property.} \\
b \approx 6.013 & \\
\end{array}
\]

Because we are solving for a length, we use only the positive square root. Now that we know the length \(b,\) we can use the Law of Sines to fill in the remaining angles of the triangle. Solving for angle \(α,\) we have

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{\sin α}{a} = \frac{\sin β}{b} & \\
\frac{\sin α}{10} = \frac{\sin (30°)}{6.013} & \\
\sin α = \frac{10 \sin (30°)}{6.013} & \text{Multiply both sides of the equation by 10.} \\
α = \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{10 \sin (30°)}{6.013}\right) & \text{Find the inverse sine of } \frac{10 \sin (30°)}{6.013}. \\
α \approx 56.3° & \\
\end{array}
\]

The other possibility for \(α\) would be \(α = 180° - 56.3° \approx 123.7°.\) In the original diagram, \(α\) is adjacent to the longest side, so \(α\) is an acute angle and, therefore, \(123.7°\) does not make sense. Notice that if we choose to apply the Law of Cosines, we arrive at a unique answer. We do not have to consider the other possibilities, as cosine is unique for angles between \(0°\) and \(180°.\) Proceeding with \(α \approx 56.3°,\) we can then find the third angle of the triangle.

\[
γ = 180° - 30° - 56.3° \approx 93.7°
\]

The complete set of angles and sides is

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
α \approx 56.3° & a = 10 \\
β = 30° & b \approx 6.013 \\
γ \approx 93.7° & c = 12 \\
\end{array}
\]

# Example 2

#### Solving for an Angle of a SSS Triangle 

Find the angle \[\alpha\] for the given triangle if side \[a = 20,\] side \[b = 25,\] and side \[c = 18.\]

# Solution:

For this example, we have no angles. We can solve for any angle using the Law of Cosines. To solve for angle \(\alpha\), we have

\[
\begin{array}{llll}
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha & & & \\
20^2 = 25^2 + 18^2 - 2(25)(18) \cos \alpha & & & \text{Substitute the appropriate measurements.} \\
400 = 625 + 324 - 900 \cos \alpha & & & \text{Simplify in each step.} \\
400 = 949 - 900 \cos \alpha & & & \\
-549 = -900 \cos \alpha & & & \text{Isolate cos } \alpha. \\
\frac{-549}{-900} = \cos \alpha & & & \\
0.61 \approx \cos \alpha & & & \\
\cos^{-1}(0.61) \approx \alpha & & & \text{Find the inverse cosine.} \\
\alpha \approx 52.4° & & & \\
\end{array}
\]

Just as the Law of Sines provided the appropriate equations to solve a number of applications, the Law of Cosines is applicable to situations in which the given data fits the cosine models. We may see these in the fields of navigation, surveying, astronomy, and geometry, just to name a few.

# Example 3

# Using the Law of Cosines to Solve a Communication Problem

On many cell phones with GPS, an approximate location can be given before the GPS signal is received. This is accomplished through a process called triangulation, which works by using the distances from two known points. Suppose there are two cell phone towers within range of a cell phone. The two towers are located 6000 feet apart along a straight highway, running east to west, and the cell phone is north of the highway. Based on the signal delay, it can be determined that the signal is 5,050 feet from the first tower and 2,420 feet from the second tower. Determine the position of the cell phone north and east of the first tower, and determine how far it is from the highway.

# Solution:

For simplicity, we start by drawing a diagram similar to Figure 6 and labeling our given information.



Figure 6

Using the Law of Cosines, we can solve for the angle \(\theta\). Remember that the Law of Cosines uses the square of one side to find the cosine of the opposite angle. For this example, let \(a = 2,420, b = 5,050,\) and \(c = 6,000.\) Thus, \(\theta\) corresponds to the opposite side \(a = 2,420.\)

\[
\begin{align*}
a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \theta \\
(2,420)^2 &= (5,050)^2 + (6,000)^2 - 2(5,050)(6,000) \cos \theta \\
(2,420)^2 - (5,050)^2 - (6,000)^2 &= -2(5,050)(6,000) \cos \theta \\
\frac{(2,420)^2 - (5,050)^2 - (6,000)^2}{-2(5,050)(6,000)} &= \cos \theta \\
\cos \theta &\approx 0.9183 \\
\theta &\approx \cos^{-1}(0.9183) \\
\theta &\approx 23.3° \\
\end{align*}
\]

To answer the questions about the phone’s position north and east of the tower, and the distance to the highway, drop a perpendicular from the position of the cell phone, as in Figure 7. This forms two right triangles, although we only need the right triangle that includes the first tower for this problem.



Figure 7

Using the angle \(\theta = 23.3°\) and the basic trigonometric identities, we can find the solutions. Thus

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos(23.3°) &= \frac{x}{5,050} \\
x &= 5,050 \cos(23.3°) \\
x &\approx 4,638.15 \text{ feet} \\
\sin(23.3°) &= \frac{y}{5,050} \\
y &= 5,050 \sin(23.3°) \\
y &\approx 1,997.5 \text{ feet} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The cell phone is approximately 4,638 feet east and 1998 feet north of the first tower, and 1998 feet from the highway.

The boat turned 20 degrees, so the obtuse angle of the non-right triangle is the supplemental angle, \[180° - 20° = 160°\]. With this, we can utilize the Law of Cosines to find the missing side of the obtuse triangle—the distance of the boat to the port.

\[
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= 8^2 + 10^2 - 2(8)(10)\cos(160°) \\

1042_concept_1,concept,1042,"# Using Heron’s Formula to Find the Area of a Triangle

We already learned how to find the area of an oblique triangle when we know two sides and an angle. We also know the formula to find the area of a triangle using the base and the height. When we know the three sides, however, we can use Heron’s formula instead of finding the height. Heron of Alexandria was a geometer who lived during the first century A.D. He discovered a formula for finding the area of oblique triangles when three sides are known.

### Heron’s Formula

Heron’s formula finds the area of oblique triangles in which sides \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are known.

\[
Area = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \(s = \frac{(a+b+c)}{2}\) is one half of the perimeter of the triangle, sometimes called the semi-perimeter.

# Example 5

#### Using Heron’s Formula to Find the Area of a Given Triangle
Find the area of the triangle in Figure 9 using Heron’s formula.



Figure 9

# Solution:

First, we calculate \(s.\)

\[
\begin{array}{l}
s = \frac{(a + b + c)}{2} \\
s = \frac{(10 + 15 + 7)}{2} = 16
\end{array}
\]

Then we apply the formula.

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \\
\text{Area} = \sqrt{16(16 - 10)(16 - 15)(16 - 7)} \\
\text{Area} \approx 29.4
\end{array}
\]

The area is approximately 29.4 square units.

# Example 6

# Applying Heron’s Formula to a Real-World Problem

A Chicago city developer wants to construct a building consisting of artist’s lofts on a triangular lot bordered by Rush Street, Wabash Avenue, and Pearson Street. The frontage along Rush Street is approximately 62.4 meters, along Wabash Avenue it is approximately 43.5 meters, and along Pearson Street it is approximately 34.1 meters. How many square meters are available to the developer? See Figure 10 for a view of the city property.



Figure 10

# Solution:

Find the measurement for \(s\), which is one-half of the perimeter. 

\[
\begin{align*}
s &= \frac{(62.4 + 43.5 + 34.1)}{2} \\
s &= 70 \text{m}
\end{align*}
\]

Apply Heron’s formula.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Area} &= \sqrt{70(70 - 62.4)(70 - 43.5)(70 - 34.1)} \\
\text{Area} &= \sqrt{506,118.2} \\
\text{Area} &\approx 711.4
\end{align*}
\]

The developer has about 711.4 square meters.

1044_concept_1,concept,1044,"# Plotting Points Using Polar Coordinates

When we think about plotting points in the plane, we usually think of rectangular coordinates \[(x, y)\] in the Cartesian coordinate plane. However, there are other ways of writing a coordinate pair and other types of grid systems. In this section, we introduce to polar coordinates, which are points labeled \[(r, θ)\] and plotted on a polar grid. The polar grid is represented as a series of concentric circles radiating out from the pole, or the origin of the coordinate plane.

The polar grid is scaled as the unit circle with the positive x-axis now viewed as the polar axis and the origin as the pole. The first coordinate \[r\] is the radius or length of the directed line segment from the pole. The angle \[θ,\] measured in radians, indicates the direction of \[r.\] We move counterclockwise from the polar axis by an angle of \[θ,\] and measure a directed line segment the length of \[r\] in the direction of \[θ.\] Even though we measure \[θ\] first and then \[r,\] the polar point is written with the r-coordinate first. For example, to plot the point \[(2, \frac{π}{4}),\] we would move \[\frac{π}{4}\] units in the counterclockwise direction and then a length of 2 from the pole. This point is plotted on the grid in Figure 2.



Figure 2

# Example 1

# Plotting a Point on the Polar Grid

Plot the point \[(3, \frac{\pi}{2})\] on the polar grid.

# Solution:

The angle \[\frac{\pi}{2}\] is found by sweeping in a counterclockwise direction 90° from the polar axis. The point is located at a length of 3 units from the pole in the \[\frac{\pi}{2}\] direction, as shown in Figure 3.



Figure 3

# Example 2

# Plotting a Point in the Polar Coordinate System with a Negative Component

Plot the point \[(-2, \frac{\pi}{6})\] on the polar grid.

# Solution:

We know that \[\frac{\pi}{6}\] is located in the first quadrant. However, \[r = -2.\] We can approach plotting a point with a negative \[r\] in two ways:

1. Plot the point \[(2, \frac{\pi}{6})\] by moving \[\frac{\pi}{6}\] in the counterclockwise direction and extending a directed line segment 2 units into the first quadrant. Then retrace the directed line segment back through the pole, and continue 2 units into the third quadrant;
2. Move \[\frac{\pi}{6}\] in the counterclockwise direction, and draw the directed line segment from the pole 2 units in the negative direction, into the third quadrant.

See Figure 4(a). Compare this to the graph of the polar coordinate \[(2, \frac{\pi}{6})\] shown in Figure 4(b).

1045_concept_1,concept,1045,"# Converting from Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates

When given a set of polar coordinates, we may need to convert them to rectangular coordinates. To do so, we can recall the relationships that exist among the variables \[x, y, r,\] and \[θ.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{x}{r} \rightarrow x = r \cos \theta \\
\sin \theta &= \frac{y}{r} \rightarrow y = r \sin \theta
\end{align*}
\]

Dropping a perpendicular from the point in the plane to the x-axis forms a right triangle, as illustrated in Figure 5. An easy way to remember the equations above is to think of \[cos \theta\] as the adjacent side over the hypotenuse and \[sin \theta\] as the opposite side over the hypotenuse.



Figure 5

### Converting from Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates

To convert polar coordinates \[(r, θ)\] to rectangular coordinates \[(x, y)\], let

\[
\cos θ = \frac{x}{r} → x = r \cos θ
\]

\[
\sin θ = \frac{y}{r} → y = r \sin θ
\]

**How To**

**Given polar coordinates, convert to rectangular coordinates.**

1. Given the polar coordinate \[(r, θ)\],  write \[x = r \cos θ\] and \[y = r \sin θ.\]
2. Evaluate \[\cos θ\] and \[\sin θ.\]
3. Multiply \[\cos θ\] by \[r\] to find the \[x\]-coordinate of the rectangular form.
4. Multiply \[\sin θ\] by \[r\] to find the \[y\]-coordinate of the rectangular form.

# Example 3

# Writing Polar Coordinates as Rectangular Coordinates

Write the polar coordinates \[(3, \frac{\pi}{2})\] as rectangular coordinates.

# Solution:

Use the equivalent relationships.

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= r \cos \theta \\
x &= 3 \cos \frac{\pi}{2} = 0 \\
\\
y &= r \sin \theta \\
y &= 3 \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 3 \\

The rectangular coordinates are \((0,3)\). See Figure 6.

1046_concept_1,concept,1046,"# Converting from Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates

To convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we will use two other familiar relationships. With this conversion, however, we need to be aware that a set of rectangular coordinates will yield more than one polar point.

# Converting from Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates

Converting from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates requires the use of one or more of the relationships illustrated in Figure 8.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{x}{r} & x &= r \cos \theta \\
\sin \theta &= \frac{y}{r} & y &= r \sin \theta \\
r^2 &= x^2 + y^2 \\
\tan \theta &= \frac{y}{x}

\]


Figure 8

# Example 5

# Writing Rectangular Coordinates as Polar Coordinates

Convert the rectangular coordinates \[(3,3)\] to polar coordinates.

# Solution:

We see that the original point \((3,3)\) is in the first quadrant. To find \(\theta\), use the formula \(\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}\). This gives

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta &= \frac{3}{3} \\
\tan \theta &= 1 \\
\theta &= \tan^{-1}(1) \\
\theta &= \frac{\pi}{4}
\end{align*}
\]

To find \(r\), we substitute the values for \(x\) and \(y\) into the formula \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). We know that \(r\) must be positive, as \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is in the first quadrant. Thus

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} \\
r &= \sqrt{9 + 9} \\
r &= \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
\]

So, \(r = 3\sqrt{2}\) and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), giving us the polar point \((3\sqrt{2}, \frac{\pi}{4})\). See Figure 9.

Analysis

There are other sets of polar coordinates that will be the same as our first solution. For example, the points \((-3\sqrt{2}, \frac{5\pi}{4})\) and \((3\sqrt{2}, -\frac{7\pi}{4})\) will coincide with the original solution of \((3\sqrt{2}, \frac{\pi}{4})\). The point \((-3\sqrt{2}, \frac{5\pi}{4})\) indicates a move further counterclockwise by \(\pi\), which is directly opposite \(\frac{\pi}{4}\). The radius is expressed as \(-3\sqrt{2}\). However, the angle \(\frac{5\pi}{4}\) is located in the third quadrant and, as \(r\) is negative, we extend the directed line segment in the opposite direction, into the first quadrant. This is the same point as \((3\sqrt{2}, \frac{\pi}{4})\). The point \((3\sqrt{2}, -\frac{7\pi}{4})\) is a move further clockwise by \(-\frac{7\pi}{4}\), from \(\frac{\pi}{4}\). The radius, \(3\sqrt{2}\), is the same.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/a92fe9168b06730b21b08f38dd3125a6167f377e"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/11eecb165b54ad5208ef0d98189beb148e97853a""]",Precalculus 2e,Converting from Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates,Polar Coordinates,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1047_concept_1,concept,1047,"# Transforming Equations between Polar and Rectangular Forms

We can now convert coordinates between polar and rectangular form. Converting equations can be more difficult, but it can be beneficial to be able to convert between the two forms. Since there are a number of polar equations that cannot be expressed clearly in Cartesian form, and vice versa, we can use the same procedures we used to convert points between the coordinate systems. We can then use a graphing calculator to graph either the rectangular form or the polar form of the equation.

# How To

**Given an equation in polar form, graph it using a graphing calculator.**

1. Change the **MODE** to **POL**, representing polar form.
2. Press the **Y=** button to bring up a screen allowing the input of six equations: \[r_1, r_2, ..., r_6.\]
3. Enter the polar equation, set equal to \[r.\]
4. Press **GRAPH**.

# Example 6

# Writing a Cartesian Equation in Polar Form

Write the Cartesian equation \[x^2 + y^2 = 9\] in polar form.

# Solution:

The goal is to eliminate \(x\) and \(y\) from the equation and introduce \(r\) and \(\theta\). Ideally, we would write the equation \(r\) as a function of \(\theta\). To obtain the polar form, we will use the relationships between \((x, y)\) and \((r, \theta)\). Since \(x = r \cos \theta\)  and \(y = r \sin \theta\), we can substitute and solve for \(r\).

\[
\begin{align*}
(r \cos \theta)^2 + (r \sin \theta)^2 &= 9 \\
r^2 \cos^2 \theta + r^2 \sin^2 \theta &= 9 \\
r^2 (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) &= 9 \\
r^2 (1) &= 9 &&&& \text{Substitute} \ \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1 \\
r &= \pm 3 &&&& \text{Use the square root property.}
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, \(x^2 + y^2 = 9\), \(r = 3\), and \(r = -3\) should generate the same graph. See Figure 10.



Figure 10: (a) Cartesian form \(x^2 + y^2 = 9\) (b) Polar form \(r = 3\)

To graph a circle in rectangular form, we must first solve for \(y\).

\[
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= 9 \\
y^2 &= 9 - x^2 \\
y &= \pm \sqrt{9 - x^2}
\end{align*}
\]

Note that this is two separate functions, since a circle fails the vertical line test. Therefore, we need to enter the positive and negative square roots into the calculator separately, as two equations in the form \(Y_1 = \sqrt{9 - x^2}\) and \(Y_2 = -\sqrt{9 - x^2}\). Press **GRAPH**.

# Example 7

### Rewriting a Cartesian Equation as a Polar Equation

Rewrite the Cartesian equation \[x^2 + y^2 = 6y\] as a polar equation.

# Solution:

This equation appears similar to the previous example, but it requires different steps to convert the equation.

We can still follow the same procedures we have already learned and make the following substitutions:

\[
\begin{align*}
r^2 &= 6y & \text{Use } x^2 + y^2 = r^2. \\
r^2 &= 6r\sin\theta & \text{Substitute } y = r\sin\theta. \\
r^2 - 6r\sin\theta &= 0 & \text{Set equal to 0.} \\
r(r - 6\sin\theta) &= 0 & \text{Factor and solve.} \\
r &= 0 & \text{We reject } r = 0 \text{, as it only represents one point, }(0,0). \\
r &= 6\sin\theta &
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the equations \[x^2 + y^2 = 6y\] and \[r = 6\sinθ\] should give us the same graph. See Figure 11.



Figure 11: (a) Cartesian form \[x^2 + y^2 = 6y\] (b) polar form \[r = 6\sinθ\]

The Cartesian or rectangular equation is plotted on the rectangular grid, and the polar equation is plotted on the polar grid. Clearly, the graphs are identical.

# Example 8

# Rewriting a Cartesian Equation in Polar Form

Rewrite the Cartesian equation \[y = 3x + 2\] as a polar equation.

# Solution:

We will use the relationships \[x = r cos θ\] and \[y = r sin θ.\]


\[
\begin{align*}
y &= 3x + 2 & \\
r\sin\theta &= 3r\cos\theta + 2 & \\
r\sin\theta - 3r\cos\theta &= 2 & \\
r(\sin\theta - 3\cos\theta) &= 2 & \text{Isolate } r. \\
r &= \frac{2}{\sin\theta - 3\cos\theta} & \text{Solve for } r. \\

1048_concept_1,concept,1048,"#  Identify and Graph Polar Equations by Converting to Rectangular Equations

We have learned how to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and we have seen that the points are indeed the same. We have also transformed polar equations to rectangular equations and vice versa. Now we will demonstrate that their graphs, while drawn on different grids, are identical.

# Example 9

# Graphing a Polar Equation by Converting to a Rectangular Equation

Covert the polar equation \[r = 2 \sec \theta\] to a rectangular equation, and draw its corresponding graph.

# Solution:

The conversion is

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= 2 \sec \, \theta \\
r &= \frac{2}{\cos \, \theta} \\
r \ \cos \ \theta &= 2 \\
x &= 2
\end{align*}
\]

Notice that the equation \(r = 2 \sec \, \theta\) drawn on the polar grid is clearly the same as the vertical line \(x = 2\) drawn on the rectangular grid (see Figure 12). Just as \(x = c\) is the standard form for a vertical line in rectangular form, \(r = c \sec \, \theta\) is the standard form for a vertical line in polar form.



Figure 12: (a) Polar grid (b) Rectangular coordinate system

A similar discussion would demonstrate that the graph of the function \(r = 2 \csc \, \theta\) will be the horizontal line \(y = 2.\) In fact, \(r = c \csc \, \theta\) is the standard form for a horizontal line in polar form, corresponding to the rectangular form \(y = c.\)

# Example 10

# Rewriting a Polar Equation in Cartesian Form

Rewrite the polar equation \[r = \frac{3}{1 - 2\cos\theta}\] as a Cartesian equation.

# Solution:

The goal is to eliminate \(\theta\) and \(r,\) and introduce \(x\)  and \(y.\) We clear the fraction, and then use substitution. In order to replace \(r\)  with \(x\) and \(y,\)  we must use the expression \[x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= \frac{3}{1 - 2 \cos \theta} & & \\
r\left(1 - 2(\frac{x}{r})\right) &= 3 & & \text{Use } \cos \theta = \frac{x}{r} \text{ to eliminate } \theta \\
r - 2x &= 3 & & \\
r &= 3 + 2x & & \text{Isolate } r \\
r^2 &= (3 + 2x)^2 & & \text{Square both sides} \\
x^2 + y^2 &= (3 + 2x)^2 & & \text{Use } x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\
\end{align*}
\]

The Cartesian equation is \[x^2 + y^2 = (3 + 2x)^2.\] However, to graph it, especially using a graphing calculator or computer program, we want to isolate \(y.\)

\[
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= (3 + 2x)^2 \\
y^2 &= (3 + 2x)^2 - x^2 \\
y &= \pm \sqrt{(3 + 2x)^2 - x^2}
\end{align*}
\]

When our entire equation has been changed from \(r\) and \(\theta\) to \(x\)  and \(y,\) we can stop, unless asked to solve for \(y\) or simplify. See Figure 13.


Figure 13

The “hour-glass” shape of the graph is called a hyperbola. Hyperbolas have many interesting geometric features and applications, which we will investigate further in Analytic Geometry.

# Analysis

In this example, the right side of the equation can be expanded and the equation simplified further, as shown above. However, the equation cannot be written as a single function in Cartesian form. We may wish to write the rectangular equation in the hyperbola’s standard form. To do this, we can start with the initial equation.

\[
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= (3 + 2x)^2 \\
x^2 + y^2 - (3 + 2x)^2 &= 0 \\
x^2 + y^2 - (9 + 12x + 4x^2) &= 0 \\
x^2 + y^2 - 9 - 12x - 4x^2 &= 0 \\
-3x^2 - 12x + y^2 &= 9 \quad &\text{Multiply through by } -1 \\
3x^2 + 12x - y^2 &= -9 \\
3(x^2 + 4x) - y^2 &= -9 \quad  \\
3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - y^2 &= -9 + 12 &\text{Organize terms to complete the square for } x \\
3(x + 2)^2 - y^2 &= 3 \\
(x + 2)^2 - \frac{y^2}{3} &= 1
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 11

# Rewriting a Polar Equation in Cartesian Form

Rewrite the polar equation \[r = \sin(2θ)\] in Cartesian form.

# Solution:

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= \sin(2\theta) & \text{Use the double angle identity for sine.} \\
r &= 2\sin\theta\cos\theta & \text{Use } \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \text{ and } \sin\theta = \frac{y}{r}. \\
r &= 2\left(\frac{x}{r}\right)\left(\frac{y}{r}\right) & \text{Simplify.} \\
r &= \frac{2xy}{r^2} & \text{Multiply both sides by } r^2. \\
r^3 &= 2xy & \\
\left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\right)^3 &= 2xy & \text{As } x^2 + y^2 = r^2, \text{ and } r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\end{align*}
\]


This equation can also be written as

\[\left(x^2 + y^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} = 2xy \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + y^2 = \left(2xy\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\]

In other words, we can fix only a planet’s *instantaneous* position. This is one application of polar coordinates, represented as \[(r, θ).\]
We interpret \[r\] as the distance from the center of the sun and \[θ\] as the planet’s angular bearing, or its direction from the center of the sun. In this section, we will focus on the polar system and the graphs that are generated directly from polar coordinates.

1050_concept_1,concept,1050,"# Testing Polar Equations for Symmetry

Just as a rectangular equation such as \[y = x^2\] describes the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) on a Cartesian grid, a **polar equation** describes a relationship between \(r\) and \(\theta\) on a polar grid. Recall that the coordinate pair \((r, \theta)\) indicates that we move counterclockwise from the polar axis (positive \[x\]-axis) by an angle of \(\theta,\) and extend a ray from the pole (origin) \(r\) units in the direction of \(\theta.\) All points that satisfy the polar equation are on the graph.

Symmetry is a property that helps us recognize and plot the graph of any equation. If an equation has a graph that is symmetric with respect to an axis, it means that if we folded the graph in half over that axis, the portion of the graph on one side would coincide with the portion on the other side. By performing three tests, we will see how to apply the properties of symmetry to polar equations. Further, we will use symmetry (in addition to plotting key points, zeros, and maximums of \[r)\] to determine the graph of a polar equation.

In the first test, we consider symmetry with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\] (\[y\]-axis). We replace \[(r, \theta)\] with \[(-r, -\theta)\] to determine if the new equation is equivalent to the original equation. For example, suppose we are given the equation \[r = 2 \sin \theta;\]

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
r = 2 \sin \theta & \\
- r = 2 \sin (- \theta) & \text{Replace } (r, \theta) \text{ with } (- r, - \theta). \\
- r = - 2 \sin \theta & \text{Identity: } \sin(- \theta) = - \sin \theta. \\
r = 2 \sin \theta & \text{Multiply both sides by } -1.
\end{array}
\]

This equation exhibits symmetry with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}.\]

In the second test, we consider symmetry with respect to the polar axis (\[x\]-axis). We replace \[(r,θ)\] with \[(r,-θ)\] or \[(-r,π-θ)\] to determine equivalency between the tested equation and the original. For example, suppose we are given the equation \[r=1-2\cos θ.\]

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
r = 1 - 2 \cos \theta & \\
r = 1 - 2 \cos (-\theta) & \text{Replace } (r, \theta) \text{ with } (r, -\theta). \\
r = 1 - 2 \cos \theta & \text{Even/Odd identity}
\end{array}
\]

The graph of this equation exhibits symmetry with respect to the polar axis.

In the third test, we consider symmetry with respect to the pole (origin). We replace \[(r, θ)\] with \[(-r, θ)\] to determine if the tested equation is equivalent to the original equation. For example, suppose we are given the equation \[r = 2\sin(3θ).\]

\[
\begin{array}{c}
r = 2\sin(3\theta) \\
-r = 2\sin(3\theta)
\end{array}
\]

The equation has failed the symmetry test, but that does not mean that it is not symmetric with respect to the pole. Passing one or more of the symmetry tests verifies that symmetry will be exhibited in a graph. However, failing the symmetry tests does not necessarily indicate that a graph will not be symmetric about the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\] the polar axis, or the pole. In these instances, we can confirm that symmetry exists by plotting reflecting points across the apparent axis of symmetry or the pole. Testing for symmetry is a technique that simplifies the graphing of polar equations, but its application is not perfect.

# Symmetry Tests

A polar equation describes a curve on the polar grid. The graph of a polar equation can be evaluated for three types of symmetry, as shown in Figure 2.



Figure 2
(a) A graph is symmetric with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\] (y-axis) if replacing \[(r, \theta)\] with \[(-r, -\theta)\] yields an equivalent equation. (b) A graph is symmetric with respect to the polar axis (x-axis) if replacing \[(r, \theta)\] with \[(r, -\theta)\] or \[(-r, \pi-\theta)\] yields an equivalent equation. (c) A graph is symmetric with respect to the pole (origin) if replacing \[(r, \theta)\] with \[(-r, \theta)\] yields an equivalent equation.

**How To**

**Given a polar equation, test for symmetry.**

1. Substitute the appropriate combination of components for \[(r, θ):\] \[(-r, -θ)\] for \[θ = \frac{π}{2}\] symmetry; \[(r, -θ)\] for polar axis symmetry; and \[(-r, θ)\] for symmetry with respect to the pole.
2. If the resulting equations are equivalent in one or more of the tests, the graph produces the expected symmetry.

# Example 1

# Testing a Polar Equation for Symmetry

Test the equation \[r = 2\sin \theta\] for symmetry.

# Solution:

Test for each of the three types of symmetry.

1) Replacing \((r, \theta)\) with \((-r, -\theta)\) yields the same result. Thus, the graph is symmetric with respect to the line \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\).
\[
\begin{align*}
- r & = 2 \sin(-\theta) \\
- r & = -2 \sin \theta \quad \text{Even-odd identity} \\
r & = 2 \sin \theta \quad \text{Multiply by -1} \\
\text{Passed} & \\
\end{align*}
\]

2) Replacing \(\theta\) with \(-\theta\) does not yield the same equation. Therefore, the graph fails the test and may or may not be symmetric with respect to the polar axis.
\[
\begin{align*}
r & = 2 \sin(-\theta) \\
r & = -2 \sin \theta \quad \text{Even-odd identity} \\
r & = -2 \sin \theta \neq 2 \sin \theta \\
\text{Failed} & \\
\end{align*}
\]

3) Replacing \(r\) with \(-r\) changes the equation and fails the test. The graph may or may not be symmetric with respect to the pole.
\[
\begin{align*}
- r & = 2 \sin \theta \\
r & = -2 \sin \theta \neq 2 \sin \theta \\
\text{Failed} & \\
\end{align*}
\]

Analysis

Using a graphing calculator, we can see that the equation \[r = 2 \sin θ\] is a circle centered at \[(0,1)\] with radius \[r = 1\] and is indeed symmetric to the line \[θ = \frac{π}{2}.\] We can also see that the graph is not symmetric with the polar axis or the pole. See Figure 3.

1051_concept_1,concept,1051,"# Graphing Polar Equations by Plotting Points

To graph in the rectangular coordinate system we construct a table of \[x\] and \[y\] values. To graph in the polar coordinate system we construct a table of \[\theta\] and \[r\] values. We enter values of \[\theta\]
into a polar equation and calculate \[r.\] However, using the properties of symmetry and finding key values of \[\theta\] and \[r\] means fewer calculations will be needed.

Finding Zeros and Maxima

To find the zeros of a polar equation, we solve for the values of \[\theta\] that result in \[r = 0.\] Recall that, to find the zeros of polynomial functions, we set the equation equal to zero and then solve for \[x.\] We use the same process for polar equations. Set \[r = 0,\] and solve for \[\theta.\]

For many of the forms we will encounter, the maximum value of a polar equation is found by substituting those values of \[\theta\] into the equation that result in the maximum value of the trigonometric functions. Consider \[r = 5 \cos \theta;\] the maximum distance between the curve and the pole is 5 units.  The maximum value of the cosine function is 1 when \[\theta = 0,\] so our polar equation is \[5 \cos \theta,\] and the value \[\theta = 0\]  will yield the maximum \[|r|.\]

Similarly, the maximum value of the sine function is 1 when \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\] and if our polar equation is \[r = 5 \sin \theta,\] the value \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\] will yield the maximum \[|r|.\] We may find additional information by calculating values of \[r\] when \[\theta = 0.\] These points would be polar axis intercepts, which may be helpful in drawing the graph and identifying the curve of a polar equation.

# Example 2

# Finding Zeros and Maximum Values for a Polar Equation

Using the equation in Example 1, find the zeros and maximum \[|r|\] and, if necessary, the polar axis intercepts of \[r = 2\sin \theta.\]

# Solution:

To find the zeros, set \(r\) equal to zero and solve for \(\theta\).

\[
\begin{align*}
2\sin\theta &= 0 \\
\sin\theta &= 0 \\
\theta &= \sin^{-1}0 \\
\theta &= n\pi \quad \text{where \(n\) is an integer}
\end{align*}
\]

Substitute any one of the \(\theta\) values into the equation. We will use \(0\).

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= 2\sin(0) \\
r &= 0
\end{align*}
\]

The points \((0,0)\) and \((0,±n\pi)\) are the zeros of the equation. They all coincide, so only one point is visible on the graph. This point is also the only polar axis intercept.

To find the maximum value of the equation, look at the maximum value of the trigonometric function \(\sin\theta\), which occurs when \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} ± 2k\pi\) resulting in \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1\). Substitute \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) for \(\theta\).

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\
r &= 2(1) \\
r &= 2
\end{align*}
\]

The point \((2,\frac{\pi}{2})\) will be the maximum value on the graph. Let’s plot a few more points to verify the graph of a circle. See Table 2 and Figure 4.

| \(\theta\) | \(r = 2\sin\theta\) | \(r\) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | \(r = 2\sin(0) = 0\) | 0 |
| \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) | \(r = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = 1\) | 1 |
| \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) | \(r = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \approx 1.73\) | 1.73 |
| \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) | \(r = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 2\) | 2 |
| \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) | \(r = 2\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \approx 1.73\) | 1.73 |
| \(\frac{5\pi}{6}\) | \(r = 2\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = 1\) | 1 |
| \(\pi\) | \(r = 2\sin(\pi) = 0\) | 0 |

Investigating Circles

Now we have seen the equation of a circle in the polar coordinate system. In the last two examples, the same equation was used to illustrate the properties of symmetry and demonstrate how to find the zeros, maximum values, and plotted points that produced the graphs. However, the circle is only one of many shapes in the set of polar curves.

There are five classic polar curves: **cardioids**, **limaҫons, lemniscates, rose curves**, and **Archimedes’ spirals**. We will briefly touch on the polar formulas for the circle before moving on to the classic curves and their variations.

### Formulas for the Equation of a Circle

Some of the formulas that produce the graph of a circle in polar coordinates are given by \[r = a \cos θ\] and \[r = a \sin θ,\] where \[a\] is the diameter of the circle or the distance from the pole to the farthest point on the circumference. The radius is \[\frac{|a|}{2},\] or one-half the diameter. For \[r = a \cos θ,\] the center is \[\left(\frac{a}{2}, 0\right).\] For \[r = a \sin θ,\] the center is \[\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{π}{2}\right).\] Figure 5 shows the graphs of these four circles.



Figure 5

# Example 3

# Sketching the Graph of a Polar Equation for a Circle

Sketch the graph of \[r = 4\cos \theta .\]

# Solution:

First, testing the equation for symmetry, we find that the graph is symmetric about the polar axis. Next, we find the zeros and maximum \[|r|\] for \[r=4\cos\theta.\] First, set \[r=0,\] and solve for \[\theta.\] Thus, a zero occurs at \[\theta=\frac{\pi}{2} \pm k\pi.\] A key point to plot is \[(0, \frac{\pi}{2}).\] 

To find the maximum value of \[r,\]  note that the maximum value of the cosine function is 1 when \[\theta=0 \pm 2k\pi.\] Substitute \[\theta=0\] into the equation:

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= 4\cos\theta \\
r &= 4\cos(0) \\
r &= 4(1) = 4
\end{align*}
\]

The maximum value of the equation is 4. A key point to plot is \[(4, 0).\]

As \[r=4\cos\theta\]  is symmetric with respect to the polar axis, we only need to calculate r-values for \[\theta\] over the interval \[[0, \pi].\] Points in the upper quadrant can then be reflected to the lower quadrant. Make a table of values similar to Table 3. The graph is shown in Figure 6.

| **θ** | 0 | \[\frac{\pi}{6}\] | \[\frac{\pi}{4}\] | \[\frac{\pi}{3}\] | \[\frac{\pi}{2}\] | \[\frac{2\pi}{3}\] | \[\frac{3\pi}{4}\] | \[\frac{5\pi}{6}\] | \[\pi\] |
|-------|---|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------|
| **r** | 4 | 3.46             | 2.83             | 2                | 0                | -2               | -2.83            | -3.46            | -4   |

Table 3



Figure 6

Investigating Cardioids

While translating from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates may seem simpler in some instances, graphing the classic curves is actually less complicated in the polar system. The next curve is called a cardioid, as it resembles a heart. This shape is often included with the family of curves called limaçons, but here we will discuss the cardioid on its own.

### Formulas for a Cardioid

The formulas that produce the graphs of a cardioid are given by \[r = a ± b \cos θ\] and \[r = a ± b \sin θ\] where \[a > 0,\] \[b > 0,\] and \[\frac{a}{b} = 1.\] The cardioid graph passes through the pole, as we can see in Figure 7.



Figure 7

**How To**

**Given the polar equation of a cardioid, sketch its graph.**

1. Check equation for the three types of symmetry.
2. Find the zeros. Set \[r = 0.\]
3. Find the maximum value of the equation according to the maximum value of the trigonometric expression.
4. Make a table of values for \[r\] and \[θ.\]
5. Plot the points and sketch the graph.

# Example 4

# Sketching the Graph of a Cardioid 

Sketch the graph of \[r = 2 + 2cos \theta .\]

# Solution:

First, testing the equation for symmetry, we find that the graph of this equation will be symmetric about the polar axis. Next, we find the zeros and maximums.  Setting \[r = 0,\] we have \[θ = π + 2kπ.\] The zero of the equation is located at \[(0, π).\] The graph passes through this point.

The maximum value of \[r = 2 + 2\cos θ\] occurs when \[\cos θ\]  is a maximum, which is when \[\cos θ = 1\] or when \[θ = 0.\] Substitute \[θ = 0\] into the equation, and solve for \[r.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= 2 + 2\cos(0) \\
r &= 2 + 2(1) = 4
\end{align*}
\]

The point \[(4, 0)\] is the maximum value on the graph.

We found that the polar equation is symmetric with respect to the polar axis, but as it extends to all four quadrants, we need to plot values over the interval \[[0, π].\] The upper portion of the graph is then reflected over the polar axis. Next, we make a table of values, as in Table 4, and then we plot the points and draw the graph. See Figure 8.

| θ | 0 | π/4 | π/2 | 2π/3 | π |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|---|
| r | 4 | 3.41| 2   | 1    | 0 |

Table 4



Figure 8

Investigating Limaçons

The word limaçon is Old French for “snail,” a name that describes the shape of the graph. As mentioned earlier, the cardioid is a member of the limaçon family, and we can see the similarities in the graphs. The other images in this category include the one-loop limaçon and the two-loop (or inner-loop) limaçon. **One-loop limaçons** are sometimes referred to as dimpled limaçons when \[1 \lt \frac{a}{b} \lt 2\] and convex limaçons when \[\frac{a}{b} ≥ 2.\]

### Formulas for One-Loop Limaçons

The formulas that produce the graph of a dimpled one-loop limaçon are given by \[r = a ± b cos θ\] and \[r = a ± b sin θ\] where \[a > 0, b > 0,\] and \[1 \lt \frac{a}{b} \lt 2.\] All four graphs are shown in Figure 9.



Figure 9: Dimpled limaçons

# How To

**Given a polar equation for a one-loop limaçon, sketch the graph.**

1. Test the equation for symmetry. Remember that failing a symmetry test does not mean that the shape will not exhibit symmetry. Often the symmetry may reveal itself when the points are plotted.
2. Find the zeros.
3. Find the maximum values according to the trigonometric expression.
4. Make a table.
5. Plot the points and sketch the graph.

# Example 5

# Sketching the Graph of a One-Loop Limaçon
Graph the equation \[r = 4 - 3\sin \theta .\]

# Solution:

First, testing the equation for symmetry, we find that it fails all three symmetry tests, meaning that the graph may or may not exhibit symmetry, so we cannot use the symmetry to help us graph it. However, this equation has a graph that clearly displays symmetry with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\] yet it fails all the three symmetry tests. A graphing calculator will immediately illustrate the graph’s reflective quality.

Next, we find the zeros and maximum, and plot the reflecting points to verify any symmetry. Setting \(r = 0\) results in \(\theta\) being undefined. What does this mean? How could \(\theta\) be undefined? The angle \(\theta\) is undefined for any value of \(\sin \theta > 1.\) Therefore, \(\theta\) is undefined because there is no value of \(\theta\) for which \(\sin \theta > 1.\) Consequently, the graph does not pass through the pole. Perhaps the graph does cross the polar axis, but not at the pole. We can investigate other intercepts by calculating \(r\) when \(\theta = 0.\)

\[
\begin{align*}
r(0) &= 4 - 3\sin(0) \\
r &= 4 - 3 \cdot 0 = 4
\end{align*}
\]

So, there is at least one polar axis intercept at \((4, 0).\)

Next, as the maximum value of the sine function is 1 when \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\) we will substitute \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\) into the equation and solve for \(r.\) Thus, \(r = 1.\)

Make a table of the coordinates similar to Table 5.

| \(\theta\) | 0 | \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) | \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) | \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) | \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) | \(\frac{5\pi}{6}\) | \(\pi\) | \(\frac{7\pi}{6}\) | \(\frac{4\pi}{3}\) | \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) | \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\) | \(\frac{11\pi}{6}\) | \(2\pi\) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r | 4 | 2.5 | 1.4 | 1 | 1.4 | 2.5 | 4 | 5.5 | 6.6 | 7 | 6.6 | 5.5 | 4 |

Table 5

The graph is shown in Figure 10.



Figure 10: One-loop limaçon

This is an example of a curve for which making a table of values is critical to producing an accurate graph. The symmetry tests fail; the zero is undefined. While it may be apparent that an equation involving \(\sin \theta\) is likely symmetric with respect to the line \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\) evaluating more points helps to verify that the graph is correct.

Another type of limaçon, the **inner-loop limaçon**, is named for the loop formed inside the general limaçon shape. It was discovered by the German artist Albrecht Dürer(1471-1528), who revealed a method for drawing the inner-loop limaçon in his 1525 book Underweysung der Messing. A century later, the father of mathematician Blaise Pascal, Étienne Pascal(1588-1651), rediscovered it.

### Formulas for Inner-Loop Limaçons

The formulas that generate the inner-loop limaçons are given by \[r = a ± b \cos θ\] and \[r = a ± b \sin θ\] where \[a > 0,\] \[b > 0,\] and \[a \lt b.\] The graph of the inner-loop limaçon passes through the pole twice: once for the outer loop, and once for the inner loop. See Figure 11 for the graphs.



Figure 11

# Example 6

# Sketching the Graph of an Inner-Loop Limaçon

Sketch the graph of \[r = 2 + 5 \cos \theta .\]

# Solution:

Testing for symmetry, we find that the graph of the equation is symmetric about the polar axis. Next, finding the zeros reveals that when \[r = 0,\] \[\theta = 1.98.\]
The maximum \[| r |\] is found when \[\cos \theta = 1\] or when \[\theta = 0.\] Thus, the maximum is found at the point (7, 0).

Even though we have found symmetry, the zero, and the maximum, plotting more points will help to define the shape, and then a pattern will emerge.

See Table 6.

| θ | 0 | π/6 | π/3 | π/2 | 2π/3 | 5π/6 | π | 7π/6 | 4π/3 | 3π/2 | 5π/3 | 11π/6 | 2π |
|---|---|-----|-----|-----|------|------|---|------|------|-----|------|------|----|
| r | 7 | 6.3 | 4.5 | 2   | -0.5 | -2.3 | -3 | -2.3 | -0.5 | 2   | 4.5  | 6.3  | 7  |

Table 6

As expected, the values begin to repeat after \[\theta = \pi.\] The graph is shown in Figure 12.



Figure 12: Inner-loop limaçon

Investigating Lemniscates

The lemniscate is a polar curve resembling the infinity symbol \[\infty\] or a figure 8. Centered at the pole, a lemniscate is symmetrical by definition.

### Formulas for Lemniscates

The formulas that generate the graph of a lemniscate are given by \[r^2 = a^2 \cos 2θ\] and \[r^2 = a^2 \sin 2θ\] where \[a ≠ 0.\] The formula \[r^2 = a^2 \sin 2θ\] is symmetric with respect to the pole. The formula \[r^2 = a^2 \cos 2θ\] is symmetric with respect to the pole, the line \[θ = \frac{π}{2},\] and the polar axis. See Figure 13 for the graphs.



Figure 13

# Example 7

**Sketching the Graph of a Lemniscate**

Sketch the graph of \[r^2 = 4\cos2θ.\]

# Solution:

The equation exhibits symmetry with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\] the polar axis, and the pole.

Let’s find the zeros. It should be routine by now, but we will approach this equation a little differently by making the substitution \[u = 2\theta.\]

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
0 = 4\cos 2\theta & \\
0 = 4\cos u & \\
0 = \cos u & \\
\cos^{-1}0 = \frac{\pi}{2} & \\
u = \frac{\pi}{2} & \text{Substitute } 2\theta \text{ back in for } u. \\
2\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} & \\
\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} & \\
\end{array}
\]

So, the point \[(0, \frac{\pi}{4})\] is a zero of the equation.

Now let’s find the maximum value. Since the maximum of \[\cos u = 1\] when \[u = 0,\] the maximum \[\cos 2\theta = 1\] when \[2\theta = 0.\] Thus,

\[
\begin{array}{l}
r^2 = 4\cos(0) \\
r^2 = 4(1) = 4 \\
r = \pm \sqrt{4} \pm 2 \\
\end{array}
\]

We have a maximum at (2, 0). Since this graph is symmetric with respect to the pole, the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2},\]  and the polar axis, we only need to plot points in the first quadrant.

Make a table similar to Table 7.

| **θ** | 0 | \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) | \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) |
|-------|---|------------------|------------------|
| **r** | ±2 | ±√2 | 0 |

Plot the points on the graph, such as the one shown in Figure 14.



Figure 14: Lemniscate

Making a substitution such as \[u = 2\theta\] is a common practice in mathematics because it can make calculations simpler. However, we must not forget to replace the substitution term with the original term at the end, and then solve for the unknown.

Some of the points on this graph may not show up using the Trace function on the TI-84 graphing calculator, and the calculator table may show an error for these same points of r. This is because there are no real square roots for these values of θ. In other words, the corresponding r-values of \[\sqrt{4\cos(2\theta)}\] are complex numbers because there is a negative number under the radical.

Investigating Rose Curves

The next type of polar equation produces a petal-like shape called a rose curve. Although the graphs look complex, a simple polar equation generates the pattern.

### Rose Curves

The formulas that generate the graph of a rose curve are given by \[r = a \cos nθ\] and \[r = a \sin nθ\] where \[a ≠ 0.\] If \[n\] is even, the curve has \[2n\] petals. If \[n\] is odd, the curve has \[n\] petals. See Figure 15.



Figure 15

# Example 8

### Sketching the Graph of a Rose Curve (n Even)
Sketch the graph of \[r = 2 \cos 4 \theta .\]

# Solution:

Testing for symmetry, we find again that the symmetry tests do not tell the whole story. The graph is not only symmetric with respect to the polar axis, but also with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\] and the pole.

Now we will find the zeros. First make the substitution \[u = 4\theta.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
0 &= 2\cos(4\theta) \\
0 &= \cos(4\theta) \\
0 &= \cos(u) \\
\cos^{-1}(0) &= u \\
u &= \frac{\pi}{2} \\
4\theta &= \frac{\pi}{2} \\
\theta &= \frac{\pi}{8} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The zero is \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{8}.\] The point \[(0, \frac{\pi}{8})\] is on the curve.

Next, we find the maximum \[|r|.\] We know that the maximum value of \[\cos(u) = 1\] when \[\theta = 0.\] Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= 2\cos(4 \cdot 0) \\
r &= 2\cos(0) \\
r &= 2(1) = 2 \\
\end{align*}
\]

The point \[(2, 0)\] is on the curve.

The graph of the rose curve has unique properties, which are revealed in Table 8.

| **θ**  | 0   | \(\frac{\pi}{8}\)  | \(\frac{\pi}{4}\)  | \(\frac{3\pi}{8}\)  | \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)  | \(\frac{5\pi}{8}\)  | \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **r**  | 2   | 0   | -2  | 0   | 2   | 0   | -2  |

As \[r = 0\] when \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{8},\] it makes sense to divide values in the table by \[\frac{\pi}{8}\] units. A definite pattern emerges. Look at the range of \[r\]-values: 2, 0, −2, 0, 2, 0, −2, and so on. This represents the development of the curve one petal at a time. Starting at \[r = 0,\] each petal extends out a distance of \[r = 2,\] and then turns back to zero \[2n\] times for a total of eight petals. See the graph in Figure 16.



**Figure 16** Rose curve, n even

When these curves are drawn, it is best to plot the points in order, as in the Table 8. This allows us to see how the graph hits a maximum (the tip of a petal), loops back crossing the pole, hits the opposite maximum, and loops back to the pole. The action is continuous until all the petals are drawn.

# Example 9

**Sketching the Graph of a Rose Curve (n Odd)**

Sketch the graph of \[r = 2\sin(5θ).\]

# Solution:

The graph of the equation shows symmetry with respect to the line \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\]. Next, find the zeros and maximum. We will want to make the substitution \[u = 5\theta\].

\[
\begin{array}{l}
0 = 2\sin(5\theta) \\
0 = \sin u \\
\sin^{-1}0 = 0 \\
u = 0 \\
5\theta = 0 \\
\theta = 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The maximum value is calculated at the angle where \[\sin \theta\] is a maximum. Therefore,

\[
\begin{array}{l}
r = 2\sin(5 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}) \\
r = 2(1) = 2 \\
\end{array}
\]

Thus, the maximum value of the polar equation is 2. This is the length of each petal. As the curve for \(n\) odd yields the same number of petals as \(n\), there will be five petals on the graph. See Figure 17.

Investigating the Archimedes’ Spiral

The final polar equation we will discuss is the Archimedes’ spiral, named for its discoverer, the Greek mathematician Archimedes (c. 287 BCE-c. 212 BCE), who is credited with numerous discoveries in the fields of geometry and mechanics.

### Archimedes’ Spiral

The formula that generates the graph of the Archimedes’ spiral is given by \[r = θ\]
for \[θ ≥ 0.\] As \[θ\] increases, \[r\]
increases at a constant rate in an ever-widening, never-ending, spiraling path. See Figure 18.

![Two graphs side by side of Archimedes' spiral. (A) is r= theta, [0, 2pi]. (B) is r=theta, [0, 4pi]. Both start at origin and spiral out counterclockwise. The second has two spirals out while the first has one.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/34c75489d723ad46c6f693a2b0e61a12819d3520)

Figure 18

## How To

**Given an Archimedes’ spiral over \[[0, 2\pi]\], sketch the graph.**

1. Make a table of values for \(r\) and \(θ\) over the given domain.
2. Plot the points and sketch the graph.

# Example 10

# Sketching the Graph of an Archimedes’ Spiral
Sketch the graph of \[r = θ\] over \[[0, 2π]\].

# Solution:

As \(r\) is equal to \(θ\), the plot of the Archimedes’ spiral begins at the pole at the point (0, 0). While the graph hints of symmetry, there is no formal symmetry with regard to passing the symmetry tests. Further, there is no maximum value, unless the domain is restricted. 

Create a table such as Table 10.

| \(θ\) | \(\frac{π}{4}\) | \(\frac{π}{2}\) | \(π\) | \(\frac{3π}{2}\) | \(\frac{7π}{4}\) | \(2π\) |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| \(r\) | 0.785           | 1.57            | 3.14  | 4.71            | 5.50            | 6.28  |

Table 10

Notice that the \(r\)-values are just the decimal form of the angle measured in radians. We can see them on a graph in Figure 19.

# Polar Form of Complex Numbers

### Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:

- Plot complex numbers in the complex plane.
- Find the absolute value of a complex number.
- Write complex numbers in polar form.
- Convert a complex number from polar to rectangular form.
- Find products of complex numbers in polar form.
- Find quotients of complex numbers in polar form.
- Find powers of complex numbers in polar form.
- Find roots of complex numbers in polar form.

“God made the integers; all else is the work of man.” This rather famous quote by nineteenth-century German mathematician Leopold Kronecker sets the stage for this section on the polar form of a complex number. Complex numbers were invented by people and represent over a thousand years of continuous investigation and struggle by mathematicians such as Pythagoras, Descartes, De Moivre, Euler, Gauss, and others. Complex numbers answered questions that for centuries had puzzled the greatest minds in science.

We first encountered complex numbers in Complex Numbers. In this section, we will focus on the mechanics of working with complex numbers: translation of complex numbers from polar form to rectangular form and vice versa, interpretation of complex numbers in the scheme of applications, and application of De Moivre’s Theorem.",[],Precalculus 2e,Polar Form of Complex Numbers,Polar Form of Complex Numbers,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1054_concept_1,concept,1054,"# Plotting Complex Numbers in the Complex Plane

Plotting a complex number \[a + bi\] is similar to plotting a real number, except that the horizontal axis represents the real part of the number, \[a,\] and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part of the number, \[bi.\]

How To

Given a complex number \[a + bi,\] plot it in the complex plane.
1. Label the horizontal axis as the real axis and the vertical axis as the imaginary axis.
2. Plot the point in the complex plane by moving \[a\] units in the horizontal direction and \[b\] units in the vertical direction.

# Example 1

### Plotting a Complex Number in the Complex Plane

Plot the complex number \[2 - 3i\] in the complex plane.

# Solution:

From the origin, move two units in the positive horizontal direction and three units in the negative vertical direction. See Figure 1.

1055_concept_1,concept,1055,"# Finding the Absolute Value of a Complex Number

The first step toward working with a complex number in polar form is to find the absolute value. The absolute value of a complex number is the same as its magnitude, or \[|z|.\] It measures the distance from the origin to a point in the plane. For example, the graph of \[z = 2 + 4i,\] in Figure 2, shows \[|z|.\]



Figure 2

# Absolute Value of a Complex Number

Given \(z = x + yi\), a complex number, the absolute value of \(z\) is defined as

\[
|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

It is the distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\).

Notice that the absolute value of a real number gives the distance of the number from 0, while the absolute value of a complex number gives the distance of the number from the origin, \((0, 0)\).

# Example 2

### Finding the Absolute Value of a Complex Number with a Radical

Find the absolute value of \[z = \sqrt{5} - i\].

# Solution:

Using the formula, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
|z| &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
|z| &= \sqrt{( \sqrt{5} )^2 + ( -1 )^2} \\
|z| &= \sqrt{5 + 1} \\
|z| &= \sqrt{6}
\end{align*}
\]

See Figure 3.



Figure 3

# Example 3

# Finding the Absolute Value of a Complex Number

Given \(z = 3 - 4i\), find \(|z|\).

# Solution:

Using the formula, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
|z| &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
|z| &= \sqrt{(3)^2 + (-4)^2} \\
|z| &= \sqrt{9 + 16} \\
|z| &= \sqrt{25} \\

1056_concept_1,concept,1056,"# Writing Complex Numbers in Polar Form

The polar form of a complex number expresses a number in terms of an angle \[\theta\] and its distance from the origin \[r.\] Given a complex number in rectangular form expressed as \[z = x + yi,\] we use the same conversion formulas as we do to write the number in trigonometric form:

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= r \cos \theta \\
y &= r \sin \theta \\
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\end{align*}
\]

We review these relationships in Figure 5.



Figure 5

We use the term modulus to represent the absolute value of a complex number, or the distance from the origin to the point \[(x, y).\] The modulus, then, is the same as \[r,\] the radius in polar form. We use \[θ\] to indicate the angle of direction (just as with polar coordinates). Substituting, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
z &= x + yi \\
z &= r \cos \theta + (r \sin \theta)i \\
z &= r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
\end{align*}
\]

### Polar Form of a Complex Number

Writing a complex number in polar form involves the following conversion formulas:

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= r \cos \theta \\
y &= r \sin \theta \\
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\end{align*}
\]

Making a direct substitution, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
z &= x + yi \\
z &= (r \cos \theta) + i(r \sin \theta) \\
z &= r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
\end{align*}
\]

where \(r\) is the modulus and \(\theta\) is the argument. We often use the abbreviation \(r \text{cis} \theta\) to represent \(r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\).

#### Example 4

# Expressing a Complex Number Using Polar Coordinates
Express the complex number \[4i\] using polar coordinates.

# Solution:

On the complex plane, the number \(z = 4i\) is the same as \(z = 0 + 4i\). Writing it in polar form, we have to calculate \(r\) first.


\(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)
\(r = \sqrt{0^2 + 4^2}\)
\(r = \sqrt{16}\) 
\(r = 4\) 

Next, we look at \(x\). If \(x = r \cos \theta,\) and \(x = 0,\) then \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). In polar coordinates, the complex number \(z = 0 + 4i\) can be written as \(z = 4(\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) + i \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}))\) or \(4 \text{cis}(\frac{\pi}{2})\). See Figure 6.

#### Example 5

# Finding the Polar Form of a Complex Number

r = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 4^2} \\
r = \sqrt{32} \\
r = 4\sqrt{2}

\]

Find the angle \(\theta\) using the formula:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r} \\
\cos \theta = \frac{-4}{4\sqrt{2}} \\
\cos \theta = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{3\pi}{4}

Converting a complex number from polar form to rectangular form is a matter of evaluating what is given and using the distributive property. In other words, given \[z = r(\cos θ + i \sin θ)\], first evaluate the trigonometric functions \[\cos θ\] and \[\sin θ\]. Then, multiply through by \[r\].

# Example 6

### Converting from Polar to Rectangular Form

Convert the polar form of the given complex number to rectangular form:

\[

# Solution:

We begin by evaluating the trigonometric expressions.

\[\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\] and  \[\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\]

After substitution, the complex number is

\[
z = 12\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i\right)
\]

We apply the distributive property:

\[
\begin{align*}
z &= 12\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i\right) \\
  &= (12)\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + (12)\frac{1}{2}i \\

Now that we can convert complex numbers to polar form we will learn how to perform operations on complex numbers in polar form. For the rest of this section, we will work with formulas developed by French mathematician Abraham De Moivre (1667-1754). These formulas have made working with products, quotients, powers, and roots of complex numbers much simpler than they appear. The rules are based on multiplying the moduli and adding the arguments.

### Products of Complex Numbers in Polar Form 

If \[z_1 = r_1 (\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1)\] and \[z_2 = r_2 (\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2)\], then the product of these numbers is given as:

\[
\begin{align*}
z_1 z_2 &= r_1 r_2 [\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)] \\
z_1 z_2 &= r_1 r_2 \text{cis}(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{align*}
\]

Notice that the product calls for multiplying the moduli and adding the angles.

# Example 8 Finding the Product of Two Complex Numbers in Polar Form 

Find the product of \[z_1z_2,\] given \[z_1 = 4(\cos(80°) + i\sin(80°))\] and \[z_2 = 2(\cos(145°) + i\sin(145°)).\]

The quotient of two complex numbers in polar form is the quotient of the two moduli and the difference of the two arguments.

# Quotients of Complex Numbers in Polar Form

If \[z_1 = r_1 (\cos \theta_1 + i \sin \theta_1)\] and \[z_2 = r_2 (\cos \theta_2 + i \sin \theta_2)\], then the quotient of these numbers is

\[

Notice that the moduli are divided, and the angles are subtracted.

**How To**

**Given two complex numbers in polar form, find the quotient.**

1. Divide \[\frac{r_1}{r_2}.\]
2. Find \[\theta_1 - \theta_2.\]
3. Substitute the results into the formula: \[z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta).\] Replace \[r\] with \[\frac{r_1}{r_2},\] and replace \[\theta\] with \[\theta_1 - \theta_2.\]
4. Calculate the new trigonometric expressions and multiply through by \[r.\]

Finding powers of complex numbers is greatly simplified using De Moivre’s Theorem. It states that, for a positive integer \[n, z^n\] is found by raising the modulus to the \[n^{th}\] power and multiplying the argument by \[n.\] It is the standard method used in modern mathematics.

### De Moivre’s Theorem

If \(z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\) is a complex number, then

\[
z^n = r^n[\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)]
\]
\[
z^n = r^ncis(n\theta)
\]

where \(n\) is a positive integer.

# Example 10

# Evaluating an Expression Using De Moivre’s Theorem

Evaluate the expression \[(1 + i)^5\] using De Moivre’s Theorem.

# Solution:

Since De Moivre’s Theorem applies to complex numbers written in polar form, we must first write \((1 + i)\) in polar form. Let us find \(r\).

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
r &= \sqrt{(1)^2 + (1)^2} \\
r &= \sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
\]


Then we find \(\theta\). Using the formula \(\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}\) gives

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta &= \frac{1}{1} \\
\tan \theta &= 1 \\
\theta &= \frac{\pi}{4}
\end{align*}
\]

Use De Moivre’s Theorem to evaluate the expression.

\[
\begin{align*}
(a + bi)^n &= r^n [\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta)] \\
(1 + i)^5 &= (\sqrt{2})^5 [\cos(5 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}) + i \sin(5 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4})] \\
(1 + i)^5 &= 4\sqrt{2} [\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4}) + i \sin(\frac{5\pi}{4})] \\
(1 + i)^5 &= 4\sqrt{2} [-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})] \\
(1 + i)^5 &= -4 - 4i

1061_concept_1,concept,1061,"# Finding Roots of Complex Numbers in Polar Form

To find the \[n^{th}\] root of a complex number in polar form, we use the \[n^{th}\] Root Theorem or De Moivre’s Theorem and raise the complex number to a power with a rational exponent. There are several ways to represent a formula for finding \[n^{th}\] roots of complex numbers in polar form.

# The \[n^{th}\] Root Theorem

To find the \[n^{th}\] root of a complex number in polar form, use the formula given as

\[
\begin{align*}
z^{1/n} &= r^{1/n} \left[ \cos\left( \frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2k\pi}{n} \right) + i \sin\left( \frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2k\pi}{n} \right) \right]

where \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1.\) We add \(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\) to \(\frac{\theta}{n}\) in order to obtain the periodic roots.

# Example 11

# Finding the \[n^{th}\] Root of a Complex Number

Evaluate the cube roots of \[z = 8 (\cos(\frac{2π}{3}) + i \sin(\frac{2π}{3})).\]

# Solution:

We have

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 8^{\frac{1}{3}} \left[ \cos \left( \frac{\frac{2\pi}{3}}{3} + \frac{2k\pi}{3} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{\frac{2\pi}{3}}{3} + \frac{2k\pi}{3} \right) \right]
\]

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \left[ \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{2k\pi}{3} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{2k\pi}{3} \right) \right]
\]

There will be three roots: \(k = 0, 1, 2.\) When \(k = 0,\) we have

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} \right) \right)
\]

When \(k = 1,\) we have

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \left[ \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{6\pi}{9} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{6\pi}{9} \right) \right]
\]

Add \(\frac{2(1)\pi}{3}\) to each angle.

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \left( \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{9} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{8\pi}{9} \right) \right)
\]

When \(k = 2,\) we have

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \left[ \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{12\pi}{9} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{12\pi}{9} \right) \right]

Add \(\frac{2(2)\pi}{3}\) to each angle.

\[
z^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \left( \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{9} \right) + i \sin \left( \frac{14\pi}{9} \right) \right)
\]

Remember to find the common denominator to simplify fractions in situations like this one. For \(k = 1,\) the angle simplification is

\[
\frac{\frac{2\pi}{3}}{3} + \frac{2(1)\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) + \frac{2(1)\pi}{3} \left( \frac{3}{3} \right) = \frac{2\pi}{9} + \frac{6\pi}{9} = \frac{8\pi}{9}

# Parametric Equations

### Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:

- Parameterize a curve.
- Eliminate the parameter.
- Find a rectangular equation for a curve defined parametrically.
- Find parametric equations for curves defined by rectangular equations.

Consider the path a moon follows as it orbits a planet, which simultaneously rotates around the sun, as seen in [Figure 1](#Figure_08_06_001). At any moment, the moon is located at a particular spot relative to the planet. But how do we write and solve the equation for the position of the moon when the distance from the planet, the speed of the moon’s orbit around the planet, and the speed of rotation around the sun are all unknowns? We can solve only for one variable at a time.



Figure 1

In this section, we will consider sets of equations given by \[x(t)\] and \[y(t)\] where \[t\] is the independent variable of time. We can use these parametric equations in a number of applications when we are looking for not only a particular position but also the direction of the movement. As we trace out successive values of \[t,\] the orientation of the curve becomes clear. This is one of the primary advantages of using parametric equations: we are able to trace the movement of an object along a path according to time. We begin this section with a look at the basic components of parametric equations and what it means to parameterize a curve. Then we will learn how to eliminate the parameter, translate the equations of a curve defined parametrically into rectangular equations, and find the parametric equations for curves defined by rectangular equations.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/a6fd5221ef1519b8cf1030425c39d070e3aeaad1""]",Precalculus 2e,Parametric Equations,Parametric Equations,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1063_concept_1,concept,1063,"# Parameterizing a Curve

When an object moves along a curve—or curvilinear path—in a given direction and in a given amount of time, the position of the object in the plane is given by the \[x\]-coordinate and the \[y\]-coordinate. However, both \[x\] and \[y\]
vary over time and so are functions of time. For this reason, we add another variable, the parameter, upon which both \[x\] and \[y\] are dependent functions. In the example in the section opener, the parameter is time, \[t.\] The \[x\] position of the moon at time, \[t,\] is represented as the function \[x(t),\] and the \[y\] position of the moon at time, \[t,\] is represented as the function \[y(t).\] Together, \[x(t)\]  and \[y(t)\]  are called parametric equations, and generate an ordered pair \[(x(t), y(t)).\] Parametric equations primarily describe motion and direction.

When we parameterize a curve, we are translating a single equation in two variables, such as \[x\] and \[y,\] into an equivalent pair of equations in three variables, \[x, y,\] and \[t.\] One of the reasons we parameterize a curve is because the parametric equations yield more information: specifically, the direction of the object’s motion over time.

When we graph parametric equations, we can observe the individual behaviors of \[x\] and of \[y.\] There are a number of shapes that cannot be represented in the form \[y=f(x),\] meaning that they are not functions. For example, consider the graph of a circle, given as \[r^2=x^2+y^2.\] Solving for \[y\] gives \[y=±\sqrt{r^2−x^2},\] or two equations: \[y_1=\sqrt{r^2−x^2}\] and \[y_2=−\sqrt{r^2−x^2}.\] If we graph \[y_1\] and \[y_2\] together, the graph will not pass the vertical line test, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, the equation for the graph of a circle is not a function.



Figure 2

However, if we were to graph each equation on its own, each one would pass the vertical line test and therefore would represent a function. In some instances, the concept of breaking up the equation for a circle into two functions is similar to the concept of creating parametric equations, as we use two functions to produce a non-function. This will become clearer as we move forward.

### Parametric Equations 

Suppose \(t\) is a number on an interval, \(I.\) The set of ordered pairs, \((x(t), y(t))\), where \(x = f(t)\) and \(y = g(t)\), forms a plane curve based on the parameter \(t.\) The equations \(x = f(t)\) and \(y = g(t)\) are the parametric equations.

# Example 1

# Parameterizing a Curve

Parameterize the curve \[y = x^2 - 1\] letting \[x(t) = t.\] Graph both equations.

# Solution:

If \[x(t) = t,\] then to find \[y(t)\] we replace the variable \[x\] with the expression given in \[x(t).\] In other words, \[y(t) = t^2 - 1.\]  Make a table of values similar to Table 1, and sketch the graph.

| \(t\) | \(x(t)\) | \(y(t)\) |
|-------|----------|----------|
| -4    | -4       | \(y(-4) = (-4)^2 - 1 = 15\) |
| -3    | -3       | \(y(-3) = (-3)^2 - 1 = 8\)  |
| -2    | -2       | \(y(-2) = (-2)^2 - 1 = 3\)  |
| -1    | -1       | \(y(-1) = (-1)^2 - 1 = 0\)  |
| 0     | 0        | \(y(0) = (0)^2 - 1 = -1\)   |
| 1     | 1        | \(y(1) = (1)^2 - 1 = 0\)    |
| 2     | 2        | \(y(2) = (2)^2 - 1 = 3\)    |
| 3     | 3        | \(y(3) = (3)^2 - 1 = 8\)    |
| 4     | 4        | \(y(4) = (4)^2 - 1 = 15\)   |


Table 1

See the graphs in Figure 3. It may be helpful to use the TRACE feature of a graphing calculator to see how the points are generated as \[t\] increases.



Figure 3 (a) Parametric \[y(t) = t^2 - 1\] (b) Rectangular \[y = x^2 - 1\]

Analysis

The arrows indicate the direction in which the curve is generated. Notice the curve is identical to the curve of \[y = x^2 - 1.\]

# Example 2

# Finding a Pair of Parametric Equations
Find a pair of parametric equations that models the graph of \[y = 1 - x^2,\] using the parameter \[x(t) = t.\] Plot some points and sketch the graph.

# Solution:

If \[x(t) = t\] and we substitute \[t\] for \[x\] into the \[y\] equation, then \[y(t) = 1 - t^2.\] Our pair of parametric equations is 

\[
x(t) = t
\]
\[
y(t) = 1 - t^2
\]

To graph the equations, first we construct a table of values like that in Table 2. We can choose values around \[t = 0,\] from \[t = -3\] to \[t = 3.\] The values in the \[x(t)\] column will be the same as those in the \[t\] column because \[x(t) = t.\] Calculate values for the column \[y(t).\]

| \(t\) | \(x(t) = t\) | \(y(t) = 1 - t^2\) |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| -3    | -3           | \(y(-3) = 1 - (-3)^2 = -8\) |
| -2    | -2           | \(y(-2) = 1 - (-2)^2 = -3\) |
| -1    | -1           | \(y(-1) = 1 - (-1)^2 = 0\)  |
| 0     | 0            | \(y(0) = 1 - 0 = 1\)       |
| 1     | 1            | \(y(1) = 1 - 1^2 = 0\)     |
| 2     | 2            | \(y(2) = 1 - 2^2 = -3\)    |
| 3     | 3            | \(y(3) = 1 - 3^2 = -8\)    |


Table 2

The graph of \[y = 1 - t^2\] is a parabola facing downward, as shown in Figure 4. We have mapped the curve over the interval \[-3, 3\],  shown as a solid line with arrows indicating the orientation of the curve according to \[t.\] Orientation refers to the path traced along the curve in terms of increasing values of \[t.\] As this parabola is symmetric with respect to the line \[x = 0,\] the values of \[x\] are reflected across the y-axis.

# Example 3

# Finding Parametric Equations That Model Given Criteria

An object travels at a steady rate along a straight path \[(-5, 3)\] to \[(3, -1)\] in the same plane in four seconds. The coordinates are measured in meters. Find parametric equations for the position of the object.

# Solution:

The parametric equations are simple linear expressions, but we need to view this problem in a step-by-step fashion. The \[x\]-value of the object starts at \[-5\] meters and goes to 3 meters. This means the distance \[x\] has changed by 8 meters in 4 seconds, which is a rate of \[\frac{8 m}{4 s},\]  or \[2 m/s.\] We can write the \[x\]-coordinate as a linear function with respect to time as \[x(t) = 2t - 5.\] In the linear function template \[y = mx + b, 2t = mx,\] and \[-5 = b.\]

Similarly, the \[y\]-value of the object starts at 3 and goes to \[-1,\] which is a change in the distance \[y\] of −4 meters in 4 seconds, which is a rate of \[\frac{-4 m}{4 s},\]  or \[-1 m/s.\] We can also write the \[y\]-coordinate as the linear function \[y(t) = -t + 3.\] Together, these are the parametric equations for the position of the object, where \[x\]
and \[y\]
are expressed in meters and \[t\]
represents time:

\[
x(t) = 2t - 5
\]
\[
y(t) = -t + 3
\]

Using these equations, we can build a table of values for \[t, x,\] and \[y\]  (see Table 3). In this example, we limited values of \[t\] to non-negative numbers. In general, any value of \[t\] can be used.

| \(t\) | \(x(t) = 2t - 5\) | \(y(t) = -t + 3\) |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| 0     | \(x = 2(0) - 5 = -5\) | \(y = -(0) + 3 = 3\) |
| 1     | \(x = 2(1) - 5 = -3\) | \(y = -(1) + 3 = 2\) |
| 2     | \(x = 2(2) - 5 = -1\) | \(y = -(2) + 3 = 1\) |
| 3     | \(x = 2(3) - 5 = 1\)  | \(y = -(3) + 3 = 0\) |
| 4     | \(x = 2(4) - 5 = 3\)  | \(y = -(4) + 3 = -1\) |


Table 3

From this table, we can create three graphs, as shown in Figure 5.



Figure 5: (a) A graph of \[x\] vs. \[t,\] representing the horizontal position over time. (b) A graph of \[y\]  vs. \[t,\] representing the vertical position over time. (c) A graph of \[y\]  vs. \[x,\] representing the position of the object in the plane at time \[t.\]

Again, we see that, in Figure 5(c), when the parameter represents time, we can indicate the movement of the object along the path with arrows.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/6c32e053e438ff3d4b557f1fb2353d1311e4d9c8"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/ceb2277daa6d87de8fcc8ed469423bc67ba6bc04"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/e27770f704ad99e2f4219a6e145474a010e62076"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/8edcd88fc4c7c6b6e7f7e8d16f0e6684b1dff8f9""]",Precalculus 2e,Parameterizing a Curve,Parametric Equations,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1064_concept_1,concept,1064,"# Eliminating the Parameter

In many cases, we may have a pair of parametric equations but find that it is simpler to draw a curve if the equation involves only two variables, such as \[x\] and \[y.\] Eliminating the parameter is a method that may make graphing some curves easier. However, if we are concerned with the mapping of the equation according to time, then it will be necessary to indicate the orientation of the curve as well. There are various methods for eliminating the parameter \[t\] from a set of parametric equations; not every method works for every type of equation. Here we will review the methods for the most common types of equations.

Eliminating the Parameter from Polynomial, Exponential, and Logarithmic Equations

For polynomial, exponential, or logarithmic equations expressed as two parametric equations, we choose the equation that is most easily manipulated and solve for \[t.\] We substitute the resulting expression for \[t\] into the second equation. This gives one equation in \[x\] and \[y.\]

# Example 4

# Eliminating the Parameter in Polynomials

Given \[x(t) = t^2 + 1\] and \[y(t) = 2 + t\], eliminate the parameter, and write the parametric equations as a Cartesian equation.

# Solution:

We will begin with the equation for \(y\) because the linear equation is easier to solve for \(t\).

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= 2 + t \\
y - 2 &= t
\end{align*}
\]

Next, substitute \(y - 2\) for \(t\) in \(x(t)\).

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= t^2 + 1 \\
x &= (y - 2)^2 + 1 \\
x &= y^2 - 4y + 4 + 1 \\
x &= y^2 - 4y + 5 \\
x &= y^2 - 4y + 5
\end{align*}
\]

The Cartesian form is \(x = y^2 - 4y + 5\).

Analysis

This is an equation for a parabola in which, in rectangular terms, \(x\) is dependent on \(y\). From the curve’s vertex at (1,2), the graph sweeps out to the right. See Figure 6. In this section, we consider sets of equations given by the functions \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\), where \(t\) is the independent variable of time. Notice, both \(x\) and \(y\) are functions of time; so in general \(y\) is not a function of \(x\).



Figure 6

# Example 5

# Eliminating the Parameter in Exponential Equations

Eliminate the parameter and write as a Cartesian equation: \[x(t) = e^{-t}\] and \[y(t) = 3e^t,\] \[t > 0.\]

# Solution:

Isolate \[e^t.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= e^{-t} \\
e^t &= \frac{1}{x}
\end{align*}
\]


Substitute the expression into \[y(t).\]

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= 3e^t \\
y &= 3\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \\
y &= \frac{3}{x}
\end{align*}
\]

The Cartesian form is \[y = \frac{3}{x}.\]

Analysis 

The graph of the parametric equation is shown in Figure 7(a). The domain is restricted to \[t > 0.\] The Cartesian equation, \[y = \frac{3}{x}\] is shown in Figure 7(b) and has only one restriction on the domain, \[x ≠ 0.\]



Figure 7


# Example 6

# Eliminating the Parameter in Logarithmic Equations

Eliminate the parameter and write as a Cartesian equation: \[x(t) = \sqrt{t} + 2\] and \[y(t) = \log(t).\]

# Solution:

Solve the first equation for \(t\).

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
x = \sqrt{t} + 2 & \\
x - 2 = \sqrt{t} & \\
(x - 2)^2 = t & \text{Square both sides.}
\end{array}
\]

Then, substitute the expression for \(t\) into the \(y\) equation.

\[
\begin{array}{l}
y = \log(t) \\
y = \log((x - 2)^2)
\end{array}
\]

The Cartesian form is \(y = \log((x - 2)^2)\).

Analysis

To be sure that the parametric equations are equivalent to the Cartesian equation, check the domains. The parametric equations restrict the domain on \(x = \sqrt{t} + 2\) to \(t > 0;\) we restrict the domain on \(x\) to \(x > 2.\) The domain for the parametric equation \(y = \log(t)\) is restricted to \(t > 0;\) we limit the domain on \(y = \log((x - 2)^2)\) to \(x > 2.\)

Eliminating the Parameter from Trigonometric Equations

Eliminating the parameter from trigonometric equations is a straightforward substitution. We can use a few of the familiar trigonometric identities and the Pythagorean Theorem.

First, we use the identities:

\[
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= a \cos t \\
y(t) &= b \sin t
\end{align*}
\]

Solving for \[\cos t\] and \[\sin t,\] we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{x}{a} &= \cos \, t \\
\frac{y}{b} &= \sin \, t
\end{align*}
\]

Then, use the Pythagorean Theorem:

\[\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1\]

Substituting gives

\[
\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1
\]

# Example 7

Eliminating the Parameter from a Pair of Trigonometric Parametric Equations

Eliminate the parameter from the given pair of trigonometric equations where \[0 \leq t \leq 2\pi\] and sketch the graph.

\[
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= 4 \cos t \\
y(t) &= 3 \sin t
\end{align*}
\]

# Solution:

Solving for \[\cos t\] and \[\sin t,\]  we have

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 4 \cos t \\
\frac{x}{4} &= \cos t \\
y &= 3 \sin t \\
\frac{y}{3} &= \sin t
\end{align*}
\]

Next, use the Pythagorean identity and make the substitutions.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t &= 1 \\
\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{3}\right)^2 &= 1 \\
\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{9} &= 1

\]


The graph for the equation is shown in Figure 8.

When we are given a set of parametric equations and need to find an equivalent Cartesian equation, we are essentially “eliminating the parameter.” However, there are various methods we can use to rewrite a set of parametric equations as a Cartesian equation. The simplest method is to set one equation equal to the parameter, such as \[x(t) = t.\] In this case, \[y(t)\] can be any expression. For example, consider the following pair of equations.

\[
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= t \\
y(t) &= t^2 - 3

Rewriting this set of parametric equations is a matter of substituting \(x\) for \(t.\) Thus, the Cartesian equation is \(y = x^2 - 3.\)

Method 1. First, let’s solve the \(x\) equation for \(t\). Then we can substitute the result into the \(y\)  equation.

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 3t - 2 \\
x + 2 &= 3t \\
\frac{x + 2}{3} &= t
\end{align*}
\]

Now substitute the expression for \(t\) into the \(y\) equation.

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= t + 1 \\
y &= \left(\frac{x + 2}{3}\right) + 1 \\
y &= \frac{x}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + 1 \\
y &= \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{5}{3}
\end{align*}
\]

Method 2. Solve the \(y\) equation for \(t\) and substitute this expression in the \(x\) equation.

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= t + 1 \\
y - 1 &= t
\end{align*}
\]

Make the substitution and then solve for \(y\).

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 3(y - 1) - 2 \\
x &= 3y - 3 - 2 \\
x &= 3y - 5 \\
x + 5 &= 3y \\
\frac{x + 5}{3} &= y \\
y &= \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{5}{3}
\end{align*}

Although we have just shown that there is only one way to interpret a set of parametric equations as a rectangular equation, there are multiple ways to interpret a rectangular equation as a set of parametric equations. Any strategy we may use to find the parametric equations is valid if it produces equivalency. In other words, if we choose an expression to represent \[x,\] and then substitute it into the \[y\] equation, and it produces the same graph over the same domain as the rectangular equation, then the set of parametric equations is valid. If the domain becomes restricted in the set of parametric equations, and the function does not allow the same values for \[x\] as the domain of the rectangular equation, then the graphs will be different.

# Example 9

# Finding a Set of Parametric Equations for Curves Defined by Rectangular Equations

Find a set of equivalent parametric equations for \[y = (x + 3)^2 + 1.\]

# Solution:

An obvious choice would be to let \[x(t) = t.\] Then \[y(t) = (t + 3)^2 + 1.\] But let’s try something more interesting. What if we let \[x = t + 3?\] Then we have 

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= (x + 3)^2 + 1 \\
y &= ((t + 3) + 3)^2 + 1 \\
y &= (t + 6)^2 + 1
\end{align*}
\]

The set of parametric equations is

\[
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= t + 3 \\
y(t) &= (t + 6)^2 + 1
\end{align*}
\]

# Parametric Equations: Graphs

### Learning Objectives
In this section you will:

- Graph plane curves described by parametric equations by plotting points.
- Graph parametric equations.

While not every fan (or team manager) appreciates it, baseball and many other sports have become dependent on analytics, which involve complex data recording and quantitative evaluation used to understand and predict behavior. The earliest influence of analytics was mostly statistical; more recently, physics and other sciences have come into play. Foremost among these is the focus on launch angle and exit velocity, which when at certain values can almost guarantee a home run. On the other hand, emphasis on launch angle and focusing on home runs rather than overall hitting results in far more outs. Consider the following situation: it is the bottom of the ninth inning, with two outs and two players on base. The home team is losing by two runs. The batter swings and hits the baseball at 140 feet per second and at an angle of approximately \[45°\] to the horizontal. How far will the ball travel? Will it clear the fence for a game-winning home run? The outcome may depend partly on other factors (for example, the wind), but mathematicians can model the path of a projectile and predict approximately how far it will travel using parametric equations. In this section, we’ll discuss parametric equations and some common applications, such as projectile motion problems.

1068_concept_1,concept,1068,"# Graphing Parametric Equations by Plotting Points

In lieu of a graphing calculator or a computer graphing program, plotting points to represent the graph of an equation is the standard method. As long as we are careful in calculating the values, point-plotting is highly dependable.

### How To

**Given a pair of parametric equations, sketch a graph by plotting points.**

1. Construct a table with three columns: \[t, x(t), \text{and} y(t).\]
2. Evaluate \[x\] and \[y\] for values of \[t\] over the interval for which the functions are defined.
3. Plot the resulting pairs \[(x, y).\]

# Example 1

#### Sketching the Graph of a Pair of Parametric Equations by Plotting Points

Sketch the graph of the parametric equations \[x(t) = t^2 + 1,\] \[y(t) = 2 + t.\]

# Solution:

Construct a table of values for \[t, x(t),\] and \[y(t),\] as in Table 1, and plot the points in a plane.

Table 1

The graph is a parabola with vertex at the point \[(1, 2),\] opening to the right. See Figure 2.



Figure 2

Analysis

As values for \[t\] progress in a positive direction from 0 to 5, the plotted points trace out the top half of the parabola. As values of \[t\] become negative, they trace out the lower half of the parabola. There are no restrictions on the domain. The arrows indicate direction according to increasing values of \[t.\] The graph does not represent a function, as it will fail the vertical line test. The graph is drawn in two parts: the positive values for \[t,\] and the negative values for \[t.\]

# Example 2

# Sketching the Graph of Trigonometric Parametric Equations

Construct a table of values for the given parametric equations and sketch the graph:

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 2 \cos t \\
y &= 4 \sin t
\end{align*}
\]

# Solution:

Construct a table like that in Table 2 using angle measure in radians as inputs for \(t\), and evaluating \(x\) and \(y\). Using angles with known sine and cosine values for \(t\) makes calculations easier.

| \(t\) | \(x = 2 \cos t\) | \(y = 4 \sin t\) |

| \(2\pi\) | \(x = 2 \cos(2\pi) = 2\) | \(y = 4 \sin(2\pi) = 0\) |

Table 2

Figure 3 shows the graph.


Figure 3

By the symmetry shown in the values of \(x\) and \(y\), we see that the parametric equations represent an ellipse. The ellipse is mapped in a counterclockwise direction as shown by the arrows indicating increasing \(t\) values.

We have seen that parametric equations can be graphed by plotting points. However, a graphing calculator will save some time and reveal nuances in a graph that may be too tedious to discover using only hand calculations.

Make sure to change the mode on the calculator to parametric (PAR). To confirm, the \(Y=\) window should show

\[
\begin{align*}
X1T &= \\
Y1T &= \\
\end{align*}
\]

instead of \(Y1 = .\)


# Example 3

#### Graphing Parametric Equations and Rectangular Form Together

Graph the parametric equations \[x = 5 \cos t\] and \[y = 2 \sin t.\] First, construct the graph using data points generated from the parametric form. Then graph the rectangular form of the equation. Compare the two graphs.

# Solution:

Construct a table of values like that in Table 3.

| \(t\) | \(x = 5 \cos t\) | \(y = 2 \sin t\) |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0     | \(x = 5 \cos 0 = 5\) | \(y = 2 \sin 0 = 0\) |
| 1     | \(x = 5 \cos 1 \approx 2.7\) | \(y = 2 \sin 1 \approx 1.7\) |
| 2     | \(x = 5 \cos 2 \approx -2.1\) | \(y = 2 \sin 2 \approx 1.8\) |
| 3     | \(x = 5 \cos 3 \approx -4.95\) | \(y = 2 \sin 3 \approx 0.28\) |
| 4     | \(x = 5 \cos 4 \approx -3.3\) | \(y = 2 \sin 4 \approx -1.5\) |
| 5     | \(x = 5 \cos 5 \approx 1.4\) | \(y = 2 \sin 5 \approx -1.9\) |
| -1    | \(x = 5 \cos -1 \approx 2.7\) | \(y = 2 \sin -1 \approx -1.7\) |
| -2    | \(x = 5 \cos -2 \approx -2.1\) | \(y = 2 \sin -2 \approx -1.8\) |
| -3    | \(x = 5 \cos -3 \approx -4.95\) | \(y = 2 \sin -3 \approx -0.28\) |
| -4    | \(x = 5 \cos -4 \approx -3.3\) | \(y = 2 \sin -4 \approx 1.5\) |
| -5    | \(x = 5 \cos -5 \approx 1.4\) | \(y = 2 \sin -5 \approx 1.9\) |

Table 3

Plot the \((x, y)\) values from the table. See Figure 4.



Figure 4

Next, translate the parametric equations to rectangular form. To do this, we solve for \(t\) in either \(x(t)\) or \(y(t)\), and then substitute the expression for \(t\) in the other equation. The result will be a function \(y(x)\)  if solving for \(t\) as a function of \(x\), or \(x(y)\)  if solving for \(t\) as a function of \(y\).

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 5 \cos t \\
\frac{x}{5} &= \cos t & \text{Solve for } \cos t. \\
y &= 2 \sin t \\
\frac{y}{2} &= \sin t & \text{Solve for } \sin t. \\
\end{align*}
\]

Then, use the Pythagorean Theorem.

\[
\begin{align*}
\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t &= 1 \\
\left(\frac{x}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^2 &= 1 \\
\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{4} &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Analysis

In Figure 5, the data from the parametric equations and the rectangular equation are plotted together. The parametric equations are plotted in blue; the graph for the rectangular equation is drawn on top of the parametric in a dashed style colored red. Clearly, both forms produce the same graph.

# Example 4

# Graphing Parametric Equations and Rectangular Equations on the Coordinate System

Graph the parametric equations \[x = t + 1\] and \[y = \sqrt{t}, t \geq 0,\] and the rectangular equivalent \[y = \sqrt{x - 1}\] on the same coordinate system.

# Solution:

Construct a table of values for the parametric equations, as we did in the previous example, and graph \[y = \sqrt{t}\], \[t \geq 0\] on the same grid, as in Figure 6.

1069_concept_1,concept,1069,"# Applications of Parametric Equations

Many of the advantages of parametric equations become obvious when applied to solving real-world problems. Although rectangular equations in \[x\] and \[y\] give an overall picture of an object's path, they do not reveal the position of an object at a specific time. Parametric equations, however, illustrate how the values of \[x\] and \[y\] change depending on \[t\], as the location of a moving object at a particular time.

A common application of parametric equations is solving problems involving projectile motion. In this type of motion, an object is propelled forward in an upward direction forming an angle of \[\theta\] to the horizontal, with an initial speed of \[v_0,\] and at a height \[h\] above the horizontal.

The path of an object propelled at an inclination of \[\theta\] to the horizontal, with initial speed \[v_0,\] and at a height \[h\] above the horizontal, is given by

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= (v_0 \cosθ)t \\
y &= -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + (v_0 \sinθ)t + h
\end{align*}
\]

where \(g\) accounts for the effects of gravity and \(h\) is the initial height of the object. Depending on the units involved in the problem, use \(g = 32 \, ft/s^2\) or \(g = 9.8 \, m/s^2\). The equation for \(x\) gives horizontal distance, and the equation for \(y\) gives the vertical distance.

### How To

**Given a projectile motion problem, use parametric equations to solve.**

1. The horizontal distance is given by \[x = (v_0 \cos \theta) t.\] Substitute the initial speed of the object for \(v_0.\)

2. The expression \[cos \theta\] indicates the angle at which the object is propelled. Substitute that angle in degrees for \(cos \theta.\)

3. The vertical distance is given by the formula \[y = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + (v_0 \sin \theta) t + h.\] The term \[-\frac{1}{2}gt^2\] represents the effect of gravity. Depending on units involved, use \(g = 32 ft/s^2\) or \(g = 9.8 m/s^2.\) Again, substitute the initial speed for \(v_0,\) and the height at which the object was propelled for \(h.\)

4. Proceed by calculating each term to solve for \(t.\)

# Example 5

# Finding the Parametric Equations to Describe the Motion of a Baseball

Solve the problem presented at the beginning of this section. Does the batter hit the game-winning home run? Assume that the ball is hit with an initial velocity of 140 feet per second at an angle of \[45°\] to the horizontal, making contact 3 feet above the ground.

1. ⓐ Find the parametric equations to model the path of the baseball.
2. ⓑ Where is the ball after 2 seconds?
3. ⓒ How long is the ball in the air?
4. ⓓ Is it a home run?

# Solution:

1. ⓐ Use the formulas to set up the equations. The horizontal position is found using the parametric equation for \(x\). Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= (v_0 \cos \theta) t \\
x &= (140 \cos 45°) t
\end{align*}
\]

The vertical position is found using the parametric equation for \(y\). Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= -16t^2 + (v_0 \sin \theta) t + h \\
y &= -16t^2 + (140 \sin 45°) t + 3
\end{align*}
\]

2. ⓑ Substitute 2 into the equations to find the horizontal and vertical positions of the ball.

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= (140 \cos 45°) (2) \\
x &= 198 \text{ feet} \\
y &= -16(2)^2 + (140 \sin 45°) (2) + 3 \\
y &= 137 \text{ feet}
\end{align*}
\]

After 2 seconds, the ball is 198 feet away from the batter’s box and 137 feet above the ground.

3. ⓒ To calculate how long the ball is in the air, we have to find out when it will hit ground, or when \(y = 0\). Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
y &= -16t^2 + (140 \sin 45°) t + 3 \\
y &= 0 \text{ (Set } y(t) = 0 \text{ and solve the quadratic.)} \\
t &= 6.2173
\end{align*}
\]

When \(t = 6.2173\) seconds, the ball has hit the ground. (The quadratic equation can be solved in various ways, but this problem was solved using a computer math program.)

4. ⓓ We cannot confirm that the hit was a home run without considering the size of the outfield, which varies from field to field. However, for simplicity’s sake, let’s assume that the outfield wall is 400 feet from home plate in the deepest part of the park. Let’s also assume that the wall is 10 feet high. In order to determine whether the ball clears the wall, we need to calculate how high the ball is when \(x = 400\) feet. So we will set \(x = 400\), solve for \(t\), and input \(t\) into \(y\).

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= (140 \cos 45°) t \\
400 &= (140 \cos 45°) t \\
t &= 4.04 \\
y &= -16(4.04)^2 + (140 \sin 45°) (4.04) + 3 \\
y &= 141.8
\end{align*}
\]

The ball is 141.8 feet in the air when it soars out of the ballpark. It was indeed a home run. See Figure 7.

An airplane is flying at an airspeed of 200 miles per hour headed on a SE bearing of 140°. A north wind (from north to south) is blowing at 16.2 miles per hour, as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_08_08_001). What are the ground speed and actual bearing of the plane?



Figure 1

Ground speed refers to the speed of a plane relative to the ground. Airspeed refers to the speed a plane can travel relative to its surrounding air mass. These two quantities are not the same because of the effect of wind. In an earlier section, we used triangles to solve a similar problem involving the movement of boats. Later in this section, we will find the airplane’s groundspeed and bearing, while investigating another approach to problems of this type. First, however, let’s examine the basics of vectors.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/aee9f320e092a0bf5fd2bae99b019433662e0744""]",Precalculus 2e,Vectors,Vectors,Further Applications of Trigonometry
1071_concept_1,concept,1071,"# A Geometric View of Vectors 

A vector is a specific quantity drawn as a line segment with an arrowhead at one end. It has an initial point, where it begins, and a terminal point, where it ends. A vector is defined by its magnitude, or the length of the line, and its direction, indicated by an arrowhead at the terminal point. Thus, a vector is a directed line segment. There are various symbols that distinguish vectors from other quantities:

- Lower case, boldfaced type, with or without an arrow on top such as \[v, u, w, \vec{v}, \vec{u}, \vec{w}\].
- Given initial point \[P\] and terminal point \[Q,\] a vector can be represented as \[\vec{PQ}.\] The arrowhead on top is what indicates that it is not just a line, but a directed line segment.
- Given an initial point of \[(0,0)\] and terminal point \[(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}),\] a vector may be represented as \[\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b} \rangle.\]

This last symbol \[\langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle\] has special significance. It is called the standard position. The position vector has an initial point \[(0,0)\] and a terminal point \[(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}).\] To change any vector into the position vector, we think about the change in the \[x\]-coordinates and the change in the \[y\]-coordinates. Thus, if the initial point of a vector \[\overrightarrow{CD}\] is \[C(x_1, y_1)\] and the terminal point is \[D(x_2, y_2),\] then the position vector is found by calculating.

\[
\begin{align*}
\vec{Ab} &= \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1 \rangle \\
&= \langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle
\end{align*}
\]

In Figure 2, we see the original vector \[\vec{CD}\] and the position vector \[\vec{Ab}\].



Figure 2

### Properties of Vectors

A vector is a directed line segment with an initial point and a terminal point. Vectors are identified by magnitude, or the length of the line, and direction, represented by the arrowhead pointing toward the terminal point. The position vector has an initial point at \[(0,0)\] and is identified by its terminal point \[(a,b).\]

# Example 1

# Find the Position Vector
Consider the vector whose initial point is \[P(2,3)\] and terminal point is \[Q(6,4)\]. Find the position vector.

# Solution:

The position vector is found by subtracting one \[x\]-coordinate from the other \[x\]-coordinate, and one \[y\]-coordinate from the other \[y\]-coordinate. Thus 

\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v} &= \langle 6-2, 4-3 \rangle \\
&= \langle 4, 1 \rangle
\end{align*}
\]

The position vector begins at (0,0) and terminates at (4,1). The graphs of both vectors are shown in Figure 3.



Figure 3

We see that the position vector is \(\langle 4, 1 \rangle\).

# Example 2

# Drawing a Vector with the Given Criteria and Its Equivalent Position Vector

Find the position vector given that vector \[\mathbf{v}\] has an initial point at \[(-3,2)\] and a terminal point at \[(4,5)\], then graph both vectors in the same plane.

# Solution:

The position vector is found using the following calculation:

\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v} &= \langle 4 - (-3), 5 - 2 \rangle \\
&= \langle 7, 3 \rangle
\end{align*}

Thus, the position vector begins at (0,0) and terminates at (7,3). See Figure 4.

1072_concept_1,concept,1072,"# Finding Magnitude and Direction 

To work with a vector, we need to be able to find its magnitude and its direction. We find its magnitude using the Pythagorean Theorem or the distance formula, and we find its direction using the inverse tangent function.

# Magnitude and Direction of a Vector

Given a position vector \[\mathbf{v = \langle a, b \rangle}\], the magnitude is found by \[\mathbf{|v|} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\]. The direction is equal to the angle formed with the y-axis, or with the y-axis, depending on the application. For a position vector, the direction is found by \[\tan \theta = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \Rightarrow \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\], as illustrated in Figure 5.



Figure 5

Two vectors \[v\] and \[u\] are considered equal if they have the same magnitude and the same direction. Additionally, if both vectors have the same position vector, they are equal.

# Example 3

# Finding the Magnitude and Direction of a Vector

Find the magnitude and direction of the vector with initial point \[P(-8,1)\] and terminal point \[Q(-2,-5)\]. Draw the vector.

# Solution:

First, find the position vector.

\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u} &= \langle -2, -(−8), -5, -1 \rangle \\
&= \langle 6, -6 \rangle
\end{align*}
\]

We use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the magnitude. 

\[
\begin{align*}
|\mathbf{u}| &= \sqrt{(6)^2 + (-6)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{72} \\
&= 6\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
\]

The direction is given as

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta &= \frac{-6}{6} = -1 \Rightarrow \theta = \tan^{-1}(-1) \\
&= -45°
\end{align*}
\]

However, the angle terminates in the fourth quadrant, so we add 360° to obtain a positive angle. Thus, -45° + 360° = 315°. See Figure 6.



Figure 6

# Example 4

# Showing That Two Vectors Are Equal

Show that vector \[v\] with initial point at \[(5, -3)\] and terminal point at \[(-1, 2)\] is equal to vector \[u\] with initial point at \[(-1, -3)\] and terminal point at \[(-7, 2)\]. Draw the position vector on the same grid as \[v\] and \[u\]. Next, find the magnitude and direction of each vector.

# Solution:

As shown in Figure 7, draw the vector \[v\] starting at initial \[(5,−3)\] and terminal point \[(-1,2)\]. Draw the vector \[u\] with initial point \[(-1,−3)\] and terminal point \[(-7,2)\]. Find the standard position for each. 

Next, find and sketch the position vector for **v** and **u**. We have

\[
\begin{align*}
v &= 〈−1−5,2−(−3)〉 \\
  &= 〈−6,5〉 \\
u &= 〈−7−(−1),2−(−3)〉 \\
  &= 〈−6,5〉 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Since the position vectors are the same, **v** and **u** are the same.

An alternative way to check for vector equality is to show that the magnitude and direction are the same for both vectors. To show that the magnitudes are equal, use the Pythagorean Theorem.

\[
\begin{align*}
|v| &= \sqrt{(-1-5)^2 + (2-(-3))^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{(-6)^2 + 5^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{36 + 25} \\
    &= \sqrt{61} \\
|u| &= \sqrt{(-7-(-1))^2 + (2-(-3))^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{(-6)^2 + 5^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{36 + 25} \\
    &= \sqrt{61} \\
\end{align*}
\]

As the magnitudes are equal, we now need to verify the direction. Using the tangent function with the position vector gives

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan θ &= -\frac{5}{6} ⇒ θ = \tan^{-1}(-\frac{5}{6}) \\
      &= -39.8° \\
\end{align*}
\]

However, we can see that the position vector terminates in the second quadrant, so we add 180°. Thus, the direction is -39.8° + 180° = 140.2°.

1073_concept_1,concept,1073,"# Performing Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication

Now that we understand the properties of vectors, we can perform operations involving them. While it is convenient to think of the vector \[\mathbf{u}\] \[= \langle x, y \rangle \] as an arrow or directed line segment from the origin to the point \[(x, y),\] vectors can be situated anywhere in the plane. The sum of two vectors\[u\] and\[v\], or vector addition, produces a third vector \[u\]+\[v\], the resultant vector.

To find \[u\] + \[v\], we first draw the vector \[u\], and from the terminal end of \[u\], we drawn the vector \[v\]. In other words, we have the initial point of \[v\] meet the terminal end of \[u\]. This position corresponds to the notion that we move along the first vector and then, from its terminal point, we move along the second vector. The sum \[u\] + \[v\] is the resultant vector because it results from addition or subtraction of two vectors. The resultant vector travels directly from the beginning of \[u\] to the end of \[v\] in a straight path, as shown in Figure 8.



Figure 8

Vector subtraction is similar to vector addition. To find \[u\] − \[v\], view it as \[u\] + (−\[v\]). Adding −\[v\] is reversing direction of \[v\] and adding it to the end of \[u\]. The new vector begins at the start of \[u\] and stops at the end point of −\[v\]. See Figure 9 for a visual that compares vector addition and vector subtraction using parallelograms.

# Solution:

To find the sum of two vectors, we add the components. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} &= \langle 3, -2 \rangle + \langle -1, 4 \rangle \\
&= \langle 3 + (-1), -2 + 4 \rangle \\
&= \langle 2, 2 \rangle

\]

See Figure 10(a).

To find the difference of two vectors, add the negative components of \[\mathbf{v}\] to \[\mathbf{u}\]. Thus,

\[
\begin{align*}

1074_concept_1,concept,1074,"# Multiplying By a Scalar

While adding and subtracting vectors gives us a new vector with a different magnitude and direction, the process of multiplying a vector by a scalar, a constant, changes only the magnitude of the vector or the length of the line. Scalar multiplication has no effect on the direction unless the scalar is negative, in which case the direction of the resulting vector is opposite the direction of the original vector.

# Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication involves the product of a vector and a scalar. Each component of the vector is multiplied by the scalar. Thus, to multiply \[\mathbf{v = \langle a, b\rangle}\] by \[k\], we have 

\[
k\mathbf{v} = 〈k \mathbf{a}, k\mathbf{b}〉
\]

Only the magnitude changes, unless \[k\] is negative, and then the vector reverses direction.

# Example 6

#### Performing Scalar Multiplication
Given vector v \[= 〈3,1〉\], find 3v, \[\frac{1}{2}\] v, and −v.

# Solution:

See Figure 11 for a geometric interpretation. If v = 〈3,1〉, then

\[
\begin{align*}
3v &= 〈3⋅3,3⋅1〉 \\
&= 〈9,3〉 \\
\frac{1}{2}v &= 〈\frac{1}{2}⋅3,\frac{1}{2}⋅1〉 \\
&= 〈\frac{3}{2},\frac{1}{2}〉 \\
-v &= 〈−3,−1〉
\end{align*}
\]

Analysis

Notice that the vector 3v is three times the length of v, \[\frac{1}{2}\] v is half the length of v, and –v is the same length of v, but in the opposite direction.

# Example 7

# Using Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication to Find a New Vector

Given \[u\] = 〈3,−2〉 and \[v\] = 〈−1,4〉, find a new vector w = 3u + 2v.

\[
\begin{align*}
3\mathbf{u} &= 3\langle 3, -2 \rangle \\
&= \langle 9, -6 \rangle \\
2\mathbf{v} &= 2\langle -1, 4 \rangle \\
&= \langle -2, 8 \rangle

\]

Then, add the two together.

\[
\begin{align*}
w &= 3\mathbf{u} + 2\mathbf{v} \\
&= \langle 9, -6 \rangle + \langle -2, 8 \rangle \\

1075_concept_1,concept,1075,"# Finding Component Form

In some applications involving vectors, it is helpful for us to be able to break a vector down into its components. Vectors are comprised of two components: the horizontal component is the \[x\] direction, and the vertical component is the \[y\] direction. For example, we can see in the graph in Figure 12 that the position vector \[〈2,3〉\] comes from adding the vectors \[v_1\] and \[v_2\]. We have \[v_1\] with initial point \[(0,0)\] and terminal point \[(2,0).\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_1 &= \langle 2-0, 0-0 \rangle \\
&= \langle 2, 0 \rangle
\end{align*}
\]

We also have \[v_2\] with initial point \[(0,0)\] and terminal point \[(0,3)\].

\[
\begin{align*}
\bold{v}_2 &= \langle 0-0, 3-0 \rangle \\
&= \langle 0, 3 \rangle
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the position vector is

\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v} &= \langle 2+0, 3+0 \rangle \\
&= \langle 2, 3 \rangle
\end{align*}
\]

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the magnitude of \[v_1\] is 2, and the magnitude of \[v_2\] is 3. To find the magnitude of \[v\], use the formula with the position vector.

\[
\begin{align*}
|v| &= \sqrt{|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} \\
&= \sqrt{13}
\end{align*}
\]

The magnitude of \[v\] is \[\sqrt{13}\]. To find the direction, we use the tangent function \[\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}\].

\[
\begin{align*}
\tan \theta &= \frac{v_2}{v_1} \\
\tan \theta &= \frac{3}{2} \\
\theta &= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = 56.3°

Thus, the magnitude of **v** is \[\sqrt{13}\] and the direction is \[56.3^{\circ}\] off the horizontal.

We call a vector with a magnitude of 1 a unit vector. We can then preserve the direction of the original vector while simplifying calculations.

Unit vectors are defined in terms of components. The horizontal unit vector is written as \[\mathbf{i}\] \[= 〈1,0〉\] and is directed along the positive horizontal axis. The vertical unit vector is written as \[\mathbf{j}\] \[= 〈0,1〉\] and is directed along the positive vertical axis. See Figure 14.



Figure 14

### The Unit Vectors

If **\[v\]** is a nonzero vector, then **\[\frac{v}{|v|}\]** is a unit vector in the direction of **\[v.\]** Any vector divided by its magnitude is a unit vector. Notice that magnitude is always a scalar, and dividing by a scalar is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of the scalar.

# Finding the Unit Vector in the Direction of v

Find a unit vector in the same direction as \[\mathbf{v}\] \[=\langle −5,12\rangle \].

|v| &= \sqrt{(-5)^2 + (12)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{25 + 144} \\
&= \sqrt{169} \\
&= 13

\]

Then we divide each component by \(|v|\), which gives a unit vector in the same direction as \(v\):

\[
\frac{v}{|v|} = -\frac{5}{13}i + \frac{12}{13}j
\]

or, in component form

\[
\frac{v}{|v|} = \langle -\frac{5}{13}, \frac{12}{13} \rangle

Verify that the magnitude of the unit vector equals 1. The magnitude of \(-\frac{5}{13}i + \frac{12}{13}j\) is given as

&= \frac{15}{\sqrt{1682}} + \frac{14}{\sqrt{1682}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{1682}} \\
&= 0.707107 \\
\cos^{-1}(0.707107) &= 45°

# Finding Ground Speed and Bearing Using Vectors

We now have the tools to solve the problem we introduced in the opening of the section.

An airplane is flying at an airspeed of 200 miles per hour headed on a SE bearing of 140°. A north wind (from north to south) is blowing at 16.2 miles per hour. What are the ground speed and actual bearing of the plane? See Figure 19.



Figure 19

# Solution:

The ground speed is represented by \(x\) in the diagram, and we need to find the angle \(\alpha\) in order to calculate the adjusted bearing, which will be \(140° + \alpha\). 

Notice in Figure 19, that angle \(bCO\) must be equal to angle \(AOC\) by the rule of alternating interior angles, so angle \(bCO\) is 140°. We can find \(x\) by the Law of Cosines:

\[
\begin{align*}
x^2 &= (16.2)^2 + (200)^2 - 2(16.2)(200)cos(140°) \\
x^2 &= 45,226.41 \\
x &= \sqrt{45,226.41} \\
x &= 212.7
\end{align*}
\]

The ground speed is approximately 213 miles per hour. Now we can calculate the bearing using the Law of Sines.

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin \alpha}{16.2} &= \frac{\sin(140°)}{212.7} \\
\sin \alpha &= \frac{16.2 \sin(140°)}{212.7} \\
&= 0.04896 \\
\sin^{-1}(0.04896) &= 2.8°
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the plane has a SE bearing of \(140°+2.8°=142.8°\). The ground speed is 212.7 miles per hour.

1218_concept_1,concept,1218,"# Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function

A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of the first components of each ordered pair is called the **domain** and the set of the second components of each ordered pair is called the **range**. Consider the following set of ordered pairs. The first numbers in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair is twice that of the first.

\[\{(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10)\}\]

The domain is \[\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\].
The range is \[\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\].

Note that each value in the domain is also known as an **input** value, or independent variable, and is often labeled with the lowercase letter \[x.\] Each value in the range is also known as an **output** value, or dependent variable, and is often labeled lowercase letter \[y.\]

A function \(f\) is a relation that assigns a single value in the range to each value in the domain. In other words, no \(x\)-values are repeated. For our example that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their values, this relation is a function because each element in the domain, \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), is paired with exactly one element in the range, \(\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\).

Now let’s consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms “even” and “odd” to the first five natural numbers. It would appear as

\[\{(odd, 1), (even, 2), (odd, 3), (even, 4), (odd, 5)\}\]

Notice that each element in the domain, \[\{even, odd\}\]
is *not* paired with exactly one element in the range, \[\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.\]
For example, the term “odd” corresponds to three values from the range, \[\{1, 3, 5\}\]
and the term “even” corresponds to two values from the range, \[\{2, 4\}.\]
This violates the definition of a function, so this relation is not a function.

Figure 1 compares relations that are functions and not functions.



Figure 1: (a) This relationship is a function because each input is associated with a single output. Note that input \(q\) and \(r\) both give output \(n.\) (b) This relationship is also a function. In this case, each input is associated with a single output. (c) This relationship is not a function because input \(q\) is associated with two different outputs.

### Function

A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly one output value. We say “the output is a function of the input.”

The input values make up the domain, and the output values make up the range.

# How To

**Given a relationship between two quantities, determine whether the relationship is a function.**

1. Identify the input values.
2. Identify the output values.
3. If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.

## Example 1:  # Determining If Menu Price Lists Are Functions

The coffee shop menu, shown in Figure 2, consists of items and their prices.

ⓐ Is price a function of the item?

ⓑ Is the item a function of the price?


Figure 2

# Solution

ⓐ Let’s begin by considering the input as the items on the menu. The output values are then the prices. See Figure 3.


Figure 3

Each item on the menu has only one price, so the price is a function of the item.

ⓑ Two items on the menu have the same price. If we consider the prices to be the input values and the items to be the output, then the same input value could have more than one output associated with it. See Figure 4.


Figure 4

Therefore, the item is a not a function of price.

## Example 2:  # Determining If Class Grade Rules Are Functions

In a particular math class, the overall percent grade corresponds to a grade point average. Is grade point average a function of the percent grade? Is the percent grade a function of the grade point average? Table 1 shows a possible rule for assigning grade points.

| Percent grade | 0–56 | 57–61 | 62–66 | 67–71 | 72–77 | 78–86 | 87–91 | 92–100 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grade point average | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.5 | 2.0 | 2.5 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 4.0 |

Table 1

## Solution

For any percent grade earned, there is an associated grade point average, so the grade point average is a function of the percent grade. In other words, if we input the percent grade, the output is a specific grade point average.

In the grading system given, there is a range of percent grades that correspond to the same grade point average. For example, students who receive a grade point average of 3.0 could have a variety of percent grades ranging from 78 all the way to 86. Thus, percent grade is not a function of grade point average.

## Using Function Notation

Once we determine that a relationship is a function, we need to display and define the functional relationships so that we can understand and use them, and sometimes also so that we can program them into computers. There are various ways of representing functions. A standard function notation is one representation that facilitates working with functions.

To represent “height is a function of age,” we start by identifying the descriptive variables \[h\] for height and \[a\] for age. The letters \[f, g,\] and \[h\] are often used to represent functions just as we use \[x, y,\] and \[z\] to represent numbers and \[A, B,\] and \[C\] to represent sets.

| h is f of a |  We name the function f; height is a function of age. |
| --- | --- | 
| h = f(a) |  We use parentheses to indicate the function input. |
| f(a) |  We name the function f; the expression is read as “f of a.” |

Remember, we can use any letter to name the function; the notation \[h(a)\] shows us that \[h\] depends on \[a.\] The value \[a\] must be put into the function \[h\] to get a result. The parentheses indicate that age is input into the function; they do not indicate multiplication.

We can also give an algebraic expression as the input to a function. For example \[f(a+b)\] means “first add *a* and *b*, and the result is the input for the function *f*.” The operations must be performed in this order to obtain the correct result.

### Function Notation

The notation \[y = f(x)\] defines a function named \[f.\] This is read as \[""y""\] is a function of \[x.""\] The letter \[x\] represents the input value, or independent variable. The letter \[y,\] or \[f(x),\] represents the output value, or dependent variable.

### Example 3:  # Using Function Notation for Days in a Month

Use function notation to represent a function whose input is the name of a month and output is the number of days in that month. Assume that the domain does not include leap years.

## Solution

The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if we name the function \[f,\] we write \[days = f(month)\] or \[d = f(m).\] The name of the month is the input to a “rule” that associates a specific number (the output) with each input.



Figure 5

For example, \[f(March) = 31,\] because March has 31 days. The notation \[d = f(m)\] reminds us that the number of days, \[d\] (the output), is dependent on the name of the month, \[m\] (the input).

## Analysis

Note that the inputs to a function do not have to be numbers; function inputs can be names of people, labels of geometric objects, or any other element that determines some kind of output. However, most of the functions we will work with in this book will have numbers as inputs and outputs.

### Example 4:  Interpreting Function Notation 

A function \[N = f(y)\] gives the number of police officers, \[N,\] in a town in year \[y.\] What does \[f(2005) = 300\] represent?

Solution

When we read \[f(2005) = 300,\] we see that the input year is 2005. The value for the output, the number of police officers \[(N),\] is 300. Remember, \[N = f(y).\] The statement \[f(2005) = 300\] tells us that in the year 2005 there were 300 police officers in the town.

Q&A

**Instead of a notation such as \[y = f(x),\] could we use the same symbol for the output as for the function, such as \[y = y(x),\] meaning ""*y* is a function of *x*?""**

*Yes, this is often done, especially in applied subjects that use higher math, such as physics and engineering. However, in exploring math itself we like to maintain a distinction between a function such as \[f,\] which is a rule or procedure, and the output \[y\] we get by applying \[f\] to a particular input \[x.\] This is why we usually use notation such as \[y = f(x), P = W(d),\] and so on.*

## Representing Functions Using Tables

A common method of representing functions is in the form of a table. The table rows or columns display the corresponding input and output values. In some cases, these values represent all we know about the relationship; other times, the table provides a few select examples from a more complete relationship.

Table 3 lists the input number of each month (January = 1, February = 2, and so on) and the output value of the number of days in that month. This information represents all we know about the months and days for a given year (that is not a leap year). Note that, in this table, we define a days-in-a-month function \[f\] where \[D = f(m)\] identifies months by an integer rather than by name.

| **Month number, \[m\] (input)** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Days in month, \[D\] (output)** | 31 | 28 | 31 | 30 | 31 | 30 | 31 | 31 | 30 | 31 | 30 | 31 |

Table 3

Table 4 defines a function \[Q = g(n).\] Remember, this notation tells us that \[g\] is the name of the function that takes the input \[n\] and gives the output \[Q.\]

| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q | 8 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 8 |

Table 4

Table 5 displays the age of children in years and their corresponding heights. This table displays just some of the data available for the heights and ages of children. We can see right away that this table does not represent a function because the same input value, 5 years, has two different output values, 40 in. and 42 in.

| **Age in years, \[a\] (input)** | 5 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Height in inches, \[h\] (output)** | 40 | 42 | 44 | 47 | 50 | 52 | 54 |

Table 5

**How To**

Given a table of input and output values, determine whether the table represents a function.

1. Identify the input and output values.
2. Check to see if each input value is paired with only one output value. If so, the table represents a function.

### Example 5:  Identifying Tables that Represent Functions

Which table, Table 6, Table 7, or Table 8, represents a function (if any)?

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 2     | 1      |
| 5     | 3      |
| 8     | 6      |

Table 6

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| –3    | 5      |
| 0     | 1      |
| 4     | 5      |

Table 7

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 0      |
| 5     | 2      |
| 5     | 4      |

Table 8

# Solution

Table 6 and Table 7 define functions. In both, each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. Table 8 does not define a function because the input value of 5 corresponds to two different output values.

When a table represents a function, corresponding input and output values can also be specified using function notation.

The function represented by Table 6 can be represented by writing

\[
f(2) = 1, f(5) = 3, \text{and } f(8) = 6
\]

Similarly, the statements

\[
g(-3) = 5, g(0) = 1, \text{and } g(4) = 5
\]

represent the function in Table 7.

Table 8 cannot be expressed in a similar way because it does not represent a function.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/6b41ee83a62edd93cf9e80894490f065d2031df7"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/891ac2bd18a398c550f2aae376fe76fe5b13d4d4"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/fb8854bea4c2687291cdc81c609909bada5f3c07"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/4ca8a33070cb29d5a0d84af71c52fecedce72117"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/debe52c37e0c953a4c0fa61977b6c12ed9c012bd""]",Precalculus 2e,Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function,Functions and Function Notation,Functions
1219_concept_1,concept,1219,"# Finding Input and Output Values of a Function

When we know an input value and want to determine the corresponding output value for a function, we evaluate the function. Evaluating will always produce one result because each input value of a function corresponds to exactly one output value.

When we know an output value and want to determine the input values that would produce that output value, we set the output equal to the function’s formula and solve for the input. Solving can produce more than one solution because different input values can produce the same output value.

## Evaluation of Functions in Algebraic Forms

When we have a function in formula form, it is usually a simple matter to evaluate the function. For example, the function \[f(x) = 5 - 3x^2\] can be evaluated by squaring the input value, multiplying by 3, and then subtracting the product from 5.

**How To**

Given the formula for a function, evaluate.

1. Substitute the input variable in the formula with the value provided.
2. Calculate the result.

### Example 6:  Evaluating Functions at Specific Values

Evaluate \[f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4\] at:

1. ⓐ 2
2. ⓑ a
3. ⓒ a + h
4. ⓓ Now evaluate \[\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}\]

Solution

Replace the x in the function with each specified value.

1. ⓐ Because the input value is a number, 2, we can use simple algebra to simplify.

\[
\begin{align*}
f(2) & = 2^2 + 3(2) - 4 \\
&= 4 + 6 - 4\\
&= 6
\end{align*}
\]


2. ⓑ In this case, the input value is a letter so we cannot simplify the answer any further.

\[f(a) = a^2 + 3a - 4\]

3. ⓒ With an input value of a + h, we must use the distributive property.

\[
\begin{align*}
f(a + h) &= (a + h)^2 + 3(a + h) - 4 \\
&= a^2 + 2ah + h^2 + 3a + 3h - 4
\end{align*}
\]


4. ⓓ In this case, we apply the input values to the function more than once, and then perform algebraic operations on the result. We already found that

\[f(a + h) = a^2 + 2ah + h^2 + 3a + 3h - 4\]

and we know that

\[f(a) = a^2 + 3a - 4\]

Now we combine the results and simplify.


\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} &= \frac{(a^2 + 2ah + h^2 + 3a + 3h - 4) - (a^2 + 3a - 4)}{h}\\
&= \frac{2ah + h^2 + 3h}{h}\\
&= h(2a + h + 3) \quad &\text{Factor out \(h\)}. \\
&= 2a + h + 3 \quad &\text{Simplify.}
\end{align*}
\]

### Example 7:  Evaluating Functions

Given the function \[h(p) = p^2 + 2p,\] evaluate \[h(4).\]

Solution

To evaluate \[h(4),\] we substitute the value 4 for the input variable \[p\] in the given function.

\[
\begin{align*}
h(p) &= p^2 + 2p \\
h(4) &= (4)^2 + 2(4) \\
     &= 16 + 8 \\
     &= 24
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, for an input of 4, we have an output of 24.

### Example 8:  Solving Functions

Given the function \[h(p) = p^2 + 2p\], solve for \[h(p) = 3\].

Solution

\[
\begin{align*}
h(p) &= 3 \\
p^2 + 2p &= 3 & \text{Substitute the original function } h(p) = p^2 + 2p. \\
p^2 + 2p - 3 &= 0 & \text{Subtract 3 from each side.} \\
(p + 3)(p - 1) &= 0 & \text{Factor.}
\end{align*}
\]

If \[(p + 3)(p - 1) = 0\], either \[(p + 3) = 0\] or \[(p - 1) = 0\] (or both of them equal 0). We will set each factor equal to 0 and solve for \(p\) in each case.

\[
\begin{align*}
(p + 3) &= 0, & p = -3 \\
(p - 1) &= 0, & p = 1
\end{align*}
\]

This gives us two solutions. The output \[h(p) = 3\] when the input is either \(p = 1\) or \(p = -3\). We can also verify by graphing as in Figure 6. The graph verifies that \[h(1) = h(-3) = 3\] and \[h(4) = 24\].



Figure 6

## Evaluating Functions Expressed in Formulas

Some functions are defined by mathematical rules or procedures expressed in equation form. If it is possible to express the function output with a formula involving the input quantity, then we can define a function in algebraic form. For example, the equation \[2n + 6p = 12\] expresses a functional relationship between \[n\]
and \[p.\] We can rewrite it to decide if \[p\] is a function of \[n.\]

__How To__

__Given a function in equation form, write its algebraic formula.__

1. Solve the equation to isolate the output variable on one side of the equal sign, with the other side as an expression that involves only the input variable.
2. Use all the usual algebraic methods for solving equations, such as adding or subtracting the same quantity to or from both sides, or multiplying or dividing both sides of the equation by the same quantity.

### Example 9:  Finding an Equation of a Function

Express the relationship \[2n + 6p = 12\] as a function \[p = f(n),\] if possible.

Solution

To express the relationship in this form, we need to be able to write the relationship where \(p\) is a function of \(n,\) which means writing it as \(p = [\text{expression involving n}].\)
\[
\begin{align*}
2n + 6p &= 12 \\
6p &=  12 - 2n & \text{Subtract 2n from both sides.} \\
p &= \frac{12 - 2n}{6} & \text{Divide both sides by 6 and simplify.} \\
p &= \frac{12}{6} - \frac{2n}{6}\\
p &=  2 - \frac{1}{3}n
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, \(p\) as a function of \(n\) is written as

\[p = f(n) = 2 - \frac{1}{3}n\]

Analysis 

It is important to note that not every relationship expressed by an equation can also be expressed as a function with a formula.

### Example 10:  Expressing the Equation of a Circle as a Function

Does the equation \[x^2 + y^2 = 1\] represent a function with \[x\] as input and \[y\] as output? If so, express the relationship as a function \[y = f(x).\]

Solution

First we subtract \[x^2\] from both sides.

\[
y^2 = 1 - x^2
\]

We now try to solve for \[y\] in this equation.

\[
y = ± \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

\[
= + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \ \text{and} - \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

We get two outputs corresponding to the same input, so this relationship cannot be represented as a single function \[y = f(x).\]

__Q&A__

__Are there relationships expressed by an equation that do represent a function but which still cannot be represented by an algebraic formula?__

Yes, this can happen. For example, given the equation \[x = y + 2^y\], if we want to express \[y\] as a function of \[x\], there is no simple algebraic formula involving only \[x\] that equals \[y\]. However, each \[x\] does determine a unique value for \[y\], and there are mathematical procedures by which \[y\] can be found to any desired accuracy. In this case, we say that the equation gives an implicit (implied) rule for \[y\] as a function of \[x\], even though the formula cannot be written explicitly.

## Evaluating a Function Given in Tabular Form

As we saw above, we can represent functions in tables. Conversely, we can use information in tables to write functions, and we can evaluate functions using the tables. For example, how well do our pets recall the fond memories we share with them? There is an urban legend that a goldfish has a memory of 3 seconds, but this is just a myth. Goldfish can remember up to 3 months, while the beta fish has a memory of up to 5 months. And while a puppy’s memory span is no longer than 30 seconds, the adult dog can remember for 5 minutes. This is meager compared to a cat, whose memory span lasts for 16 hours.

The function that relates the type of pet to the duration of its memory span is more easily visualized with the use of a table. See Table 10.

| Pet | Memory span in hours |
| --- | --- |
| Puppy | 0.008 |
| Adult dog | 0.083 |
| Cat | 16 |
| Goldfish | 2160 |
| Beta fish | 3600 |

Table 10

At times, evaluating a function in table form may be more useful than using equations.Here let us call the function \[P.\]
 The domain of the function is the type of pet and the range is a real number representing the number of hours the pet’s memory span lasts. We can evaluate the function \[P\] at the input value of “goldfish.” We would write \[P(goldfish) = 2160.\] Notice that, to evaluate the function in table form, we identify the input value and the corresponding output value from the pertinent row of the table. The tabular form for function \[P\] seems ideally suited to this function, more so than writing it in paragraph or function form.

**How To**

**Given a function represented by a table, identify specific output and input values.**

1. Find the given input in the row (or column) of input values.
2. Identify the corresponding output value paired with that input value.
3. Find the given output values in the row (or column) of output values, noting every time that output value appears.
4. Identify the input value(s) corresponding to the given output value.

### Example 11:  Evaluating and Solving a Tabular Function

Using Table 11,
ⓐ Evaluate \[g(3).\]
ⓑ Solve \[g(n) = 6.\]

| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| g(n) | 8 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 8 |

Table 11

Solution

ⓐ Evaluating \[g(3)\] means determining the output value of the function \[g\] for the input value of \[n = 3.\] The table output value corresponding to \[n = 3\] is 7, so \[g(3) = 7.\]
ⓑ Solving \[g(n) = 6\] means identifying the input values, \[n,\] that produce an output value of 6. The table below shows two solutions: \[2\] and \[4.\]

| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| g(n) | 8 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 8 |

When we input 2 into the function \[g,\] our output is 6. When we input 4 into the function \[g,\] our output is also 6.

## Finding Function Values from a Graph

Evaluating a function using a graph also requires finding the corresponding output value for a given input value, only in this case, we find the output value by looking at the graph. Solving a function equation using a graph requires finding all instances of the given output value on the graph and observing the corresponding input value(s).

### Example 12:  Reading Function Values from a Graph 

Given the graph in Figure 7,

ⓐ Evaluate \[f(2).\] 
ⓑ Solve \[f(x) = 4.\]



Figure 7

Solution

ⓐ To evaluate \[f(2),\] locate the point on the curve where \[x = 2,\] then read the y-coordinate of that point. The point has coordinates \[(2, 1),\] so \[f(2) = 1.\] See Figure 8.



Figure 8

ⓑ To solve \[f(x) = 4,\] we find the output value 4 on the vertical axis. Moving horizontally along the line \[y = 4,\] we locate two points of the curve with output value 4: \[(-1, 4)\] and \[(3, 4).\] These points represent the two solutions to \[f(x) = 4:\] -1 or 3. This means \[f(-1) = 4\] and \[f(3) = 4,\] or when the input is -1 or 3, the output is 4. See Figure 9.

1220_concept_1,concept,1220,"# Determining Whether a Function is One-to-One

Some functions have a given output value that corresponds to two or more input values. For example, in the stock chart shown in the figure at the beginning of this chapter, the stock price was $1000 on five different dates, meaning that there were five different input values that all resulted in the same output value of $1000.

However, some functions have only one input value for each output value, as well as having only one output for each input. We call these functions one-to-one functions. As an example, consider a school that uses only letter grades and decimal equivalents, as listed in Table 12.

| Letter grade | Grade point average |
| --- | --- |
| A | 4.0 |
| B | 3.0 |
| C | 2.0 |
| D | 1.0 |

Table 12

This grading system represents a one-to-one function, because each letter input yields one particular grade point average output and each grade point average corresponds to one input letter.

To visualize this concept, let’s look again at the two simple functions sketched in Figure 1 **(a)** and Figure 1 **(b)**. The function in part (a) shows a relationship that is not a one-to-one function because inputs \[q\] and \[r\] both give output \[n.\] The function in part (b) shows a relationship that is a one-to-one function because each input is associated with a single output.

### One-to-One Function

A one-to-one function is a function in which each output value corresponds to exactly one input value.

## Example 13:  Determining Whether a Relationship Is a One-to-One Function 

Is the area of a circle a function of its radius? If yes, is the function one-to-one?

## Solution

A circle of radius \[r\] has a unique area measure given by \[A = πr^2,\] so for any input, \[r,\] there is only one output, \[A.\] The area is a function of radius \[r.\]

If the function is one-to-one, the output value, the area, must correspond to a unique input value, the radius. Any area measure \[A\] is given by the formula \[A = πr^2.\] Because areas and radii are positive numbers, there is exactly one solution: \[\sqrt{\frac{A}{π}}.\] So the area of a circle is a one-to-one function of the circle’s radius.",[],Precalculus 2e,Determining Whether a Function is One-to-One,Functions and Function Notation,Functions
1221_concept_1,concept,1221,"# Using the Vertical Line Test

As we have seen in some examples above, we can represent a function using a graph. Graphs display a great many input-output pairs in a small space. The visual information they provide often makes relationships easier to understand. By convention, graphs are typically constructed with the input values along the horizontal axis and the output values along the vertical axis.

The most common graphs name the input value \[x\] and the output value \[y,\] and we say \[y\] is a function of \[x,\] or \[y = f(x)\] when the function is named \[f.\] The graph of the function is the set of all points \[(x, y)\] in the plane that satisfies the equation \[y = f(x).\] If the function is defined for only a few input values, then the graph of the function is only a few points, where the x-coordinate of each point is an input value and the y-coordinate of each point is the corresponding output value. For example, the black dots on the graph in Figure 10 tell us that \[f(0) = 2\] and \[f(6) = 1.\] However, the set of all points \[(x, y)\] satisfying \[y = f(x)\] is a curve. The curve shown includes \[(0, 2)\] and \[(6, 1)\] because the curve passes through those points.



Figure 10

The __vertical line test__ can be used to determine whether a graph represents a function. If we can draw any vertical line that intersects a graph more than once, then the graph does not define a function because a function has only one output value for each input value. See Figure 8.



Figure 11

## How To

__Given a graph, use the vertical line test to determine if the graph represents a function.__

1. Inspect the graph to see if any vertical line drawn would intersect the curve more than once.
2. If there is any such line, determine that the graph does not represent a function.

## Example 14:  Applying the Vertical Line Test

Which of the graphs in Figure 12 represent(s) a function \[y = f(x)\]?



Figure 12

Solution

If any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, the relation represented by the graph is not a function. Notice that any vertical line would pass through only one point of the two graphs shown in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 12. From this we can conclude that these two graphs represent functions. The third graph does not represent a function because, at most *x*-values, a vertical line would intersect the graph at more than one point, as shown in Figure 13.

Once we have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to determine if it is a one-to-one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw horizontal lines through the graph. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a one-to-one function.

**How To**

**Given a graph of a function, use the horizontal line test to determine if the graph represents a one-to-one function.**

1. Inspect the graph to see if any horizontal line drawn would intersect the curve more than once.
2. If there is any such line, determine that the function is not one-to-one.

Consider the functions shown in Figure 12(a) and Figure 12(b). Are either of the functions one-to-one?

# Solution

The function in Figure 12(a) is not one-to-one. The horizontal line shown in Figure 15 intersects the graph of the function at two points (and we can even find horizontal lines that intersect it at three points.)

In this text, we will be exploring functions—the shapes of their graphs, their unique characteristics, their algebraic formulas, and how to solve problems with them. When learning to read, we start with the alphabet. When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers. When working with functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of building-block elements. We call these our “toolkit functions,” which form a set of basic named functions for which we know the graph, formula, and special properties. Some of these functions are programmed to individual buttons on many calculators. For these definitions we will use \[x\] as the input variable and \[y = f(x)\] as the output variable.

We will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their graphs, and their transformations frequently throughout this book. It will be very helpful if we can recognize these toolkit functions and their features quickly by name, formula, graph, and basic table properties. The graphs and sample table values are included with each function shown in Table 13.

# Domain and Range

# Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:
- Find the domain of a function defined by an equation.
- Graph piecewise-defined functions.

Horror and thriller movies are both popular and, very often, extremely profitable. When big-budget actors, shooting locations, and special effects are included, however, studios count on even more viewership to be successful. Consider five major thriller/horror entries from the early 2000s—*I am Legend*, *Hannibal*, *The Ring*, *The Grudge*, and *The Conjuring*. [Figure 1](#Figure_01_02_001) shows the amount, in dollars, each of those movies grossed when they were released as well as the ticket sales for horror movies in general by year. Notice that we can use the data to create a function of the amount each movie earned or the total ticket sales for all horror movies by year. In creating various functions using the data, we can identify different independent and dependent variables, and we can analyze the data and the functions to determine the domain and range. In this section, we will investigate methods for determining the domain and range of functions such as these.

1225_concept_1,concept,1225,"# Finding the Domain of a Function Defined by an Equation

In Functions and Function Notation, we were introduced to the concepts of domain and range. In this section, we will practice determining domains and ranges for specific functions. Keep in mind that, in determining domains and ranges, we need to consider what is physically possible or meaningful in real-world examples, such as tickets sales and year in the horror movie example above. We also need to consider what is mathematically permitted. For example, we cannot include any input value that leads us to take an even root of a negative number if the domain and range consist of real numbers. Or in a function expressed as a formula, we cannot include any input value in the domain that would lead us to divide by 0.

We can visualize the domain as a “holding area” that contains “raw materials” for a “function machine” and the range as another “holding area” for the machine’s products. See Figure 2.



Figure 2

We can write the domain and range in interval notation, which uses values within brackets to describe a set of numbers. In interval notation, we use a square bracket [ when the set includes the endpoint and a parenthesis ( to indicate that the endpoint is either not included or the interval is unbounded. For example, if a person has $100 to spend, they would need to express the interval that is more than 0 and less than or equal to 100 and write \[(0, 100]\]. We will discuss interval notation in greater detail later.

Let’s turn our attention to finding the domain of a function whose equation is provided.  Oftentimes, finding the domain of such functions involves remembering three different forms.  First, if the function has no denominator or an odd root, consider whether the domain could be all real numbers.  Second, if there is a denominator in the function’s equation, exclude values in the domain that force the denominator to be zero.  Third, if there is an even root, consider excluding values that would make the radicand negative.

Before we begin, let us review the conventions of interval notation:

- The smallest number from the interval is written first.
- The largest number in the interval is written second, following a comma.
- Parentheses, ( or ), are used to signify that an endpoint value is not included, called exclusive.
- Brackets, [ or ], are used to indicate that an endpoint value is included, called inclusive.

See Figure 3 for a summary of interval notation.



Figure 3

## Example 1:  Finding the Domain of a Function as a Set of Ordered Pairs 

Find the domain of the following function: \[\{(2,10),(3,10),(4,20),(5,30),(6,40)\}\] .

Solution

First identify the input values. The input value is the first coordinate in an ordered pair. There are no restrictions, as the ordered pairs are simply listed. The domain is the set of the first coordinates of the ordered pairs.

\[\{2,3,4,5,6\}\]

**How To**

**Given a function written in equation form, find the domain.**

1. Identify the input values.
2. Identify any restrictions on the input and exclude those values from the domain.
3. Write the domain in interval form, if possible.

# Example 2:  Finding the Domain of a Function

Find the domain of the function \[f(x) = x^2 - 1.\]

# Solution

The input value, shown by the variable \(x\) in the equation, is squared and then the result is lowered by one. Any real number may be squared and then be lowered by one, so there are no restrictions on the domain of this function. The domain is the set of real numbers.

In interval form, the domain of \(f\) is \[(-\infty, \infty).\]

### How To

**Given a function written in an equation form that includes a fraction, find the domain.**

1. Identify the input values.
2. Identify any restrictions on the input. If there is a denominator in the function’s formula, set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \[x\] . If the function’s formula contains an even root, set the radicand greater than or equal to 0, and then solve.
3. Write the domain in interval form, making sure to exclude any restricted values from the domain.

# Example 3:  Finding the Domain of a Function Involving a Denominator 

Find the domain of the function \[f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{2 - x}\].

# Solution

When there is a denominator, we want to include only values of the input that do not force the denominator to be zero. So, we will set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for \(x\).

\[
\begin{align*}
2 - x & = 0 \\
-x & = -2 \\
x & = 2
\end{align*}
\]

Now, we will exclude 2 from the domain. The answers are all real numbers where \(x \lt 2\) or \(x > 2\) as shown in Figure 4. We can use a symbol known as the union, \(\cup\), to combine the two sets. In interval notation, we write the solution: \[(-\infty, 2) \cup (2, \infty)\].



Figure 4

### How To

**Given a function written in equation form including an even root, find the domain.**

1. Identify the input values.
2. Since there is an even root, exclude any real numbers that result in a negative number in the radicand. Set the radicand greater than or equal to zero and solve for \[x.\]
3. The solution(s) are the domain of the function. If possible, write the answer in interval form.

# Example 4:  Finding the Domain of a Function with an Even Root

Find the domain of the function \[f(x) = \sqrt{7 - x}.\]

Solution

When there is an even root in the formula, we exclude any real numbers that result in a negative number in the radicand.

Set the radicand greater than or equal to zero and solve for \(x\).

\[
\begin{align*}
7 - x & \geq 0 \\
-x & \geq -7 \\
x & \leq 7 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Now, we will exclude any number greater than 7 from the domain. The answers are all real numbers less than or equal to 7, or \[(-\infty, 7].\]

__Q&A__
__Can there be functions in which the domain and range do not intersect at all?__

Yes. For example, the function \[f(x) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\] has the set of all positive real numbers as its domain but the set of all negative real numbers as its range. As a more extreme example, a function’s inputs and outputs can be completely different categories (for example, names of weekdays as inputs and numbers as outputs, as on an attendance chart), in such cases the domain and range have no elements in common.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/07c120060187fc6ff9d4b472180df78db7cd2034"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/b8e583b5d39ad28fd3c67fc29332cc49b19c1cd7"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/f5b60423d3e7587eb268720f0b2b70524a8b80ed""]",Precalculus 2e,Finding the Domain of a Function Defined by an Equation,Domain and Range,Functions
1226_concept_1,concept,1226,"# Using Notations to Specify Domain and Range

In the previous examples, we used inequalities and lists to describe the domain of functions. We can also use inequalities, or other statements that might define sets of values or data, to describe the behavior of the variable in set-builder notation. For example, \[ \{ x | 10 \leq x < 30 \} \] describes the behavior of \(x\) in set-builder notation. The braces \(\{\}\) are read as “the set of,” and the vertical bar | is read as “such that,” so we would read \[ \{ x | 10 \leq x < 30 \} \] as “the set of *x*-values such that 10 is less than or equal to \(x\), and \(x\) is less than 30.”
[Figure 5 compares inequality notation,  set-builder notation, and interval notation.



Figure 5

To combine two intervals using inequality notation or set-builder notation, we use the word “or.” As we saw in earlier examples, we use the union symbol, \[\cup,\] to combine two unconnected intervals. For example, the union of the sets \[{2,3,5}\]
and \[{4,6}\]
is the set \[{2,3,4,5,6}.\] It is the set of all elements that belong to one *or* the other (or both) of the original two sets. For sets with a finite number of elements like these, the elements do not have to be listed in ascending order of numerical value. If the original two sets have some elements in common, those elements should be listed only once in the union set. For sets of real numbers on intervals, another example of a union is

\[\{x | |x| \geq 3\} = (-\infty, -3] \cup [3, \infty)\]

### Set-Builder Notation and Interval Notation

**Set-builder notation** is a method of specifying a set of elements that satisfy a certain condition. It takes the form \[\{x | \text{statement about } x\}\] which is read as, “the set of all \(x\) such that the statement about \(x\) is true.” For example,

\[\{x | 4 < x \leq 12\}\]

**Interval notation** is a way of describing sets that include all real numbers between a lower limit that may or may not be included and an upper limit that may or may not be included. The endpoint values are listed between brackets or parentheses. A square bracket indicates inclusion in the set, and a parenthesis indicates exclusion from the set. For example,

\[(4, 12]\]

**How To**

**Given a line graph, describe the set of values using interval notation.**
1. Identify the intervals to be included in the set by determining where the heavy line overlays the real line.
2. At the left end of each interval, use [ with each end value to be included in the set (solid dot) or ( for each excluded end value (open dot).
3. At the right end of each interval, use ] with each end value to be included in the set (filled dot) or ) for each excluded end value (open dot).
4. Use the union symbol \[\cup\] to combine all intervals into one set.

## Example 1:  # Describing Sets on the Real-Number Line

Describe the intervals of values shown in Figure 6 using inequality notation, set-builder notation, and interval notation.



Figure 6

# Solution

To describe the values, \(x\), included in the intervals shown, we would say, “ \(x\) is a real number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, or a real number greater than 5.”

| Inequality | \(1 \leq x \leq 3\) or \(x > 5\) |
| --- | --- |
| Set-builder notation | \[\{x \vert 1 \le x \le 3 \ \ \text{or} \ x \gt 5\]}|
| Interval notation | \([1,3] \cup (5, \infty)\)|

Remember that, when writing or reading interval notation, using a square bracket means the boundary is included in the set. Using a parenthesis means the boundary is not included in the set.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/2f9ce8337265b855f9562148a7983e0244e78701"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/8e665894cdaf2f2521c3b596e93adddf67c9f1e8""]",Precalculus 2e,Using Notations to Specify Domain and Range,Domain and Range,Functions
1227_concept_1,concept,1227,"# Finding Domain and Range from Graphs

Another way to identify the domain and range of functions is by using graphs. Because the domain refers to the set of possible input values, the domain of a graph consists of all the input values shown on the *x*-axis. The range is the set of possible output values, which are shown on the *y*-axis. Keep in mind that if the graph continues beyond the portion of the graph we can see, the domain and range may be greater than the visible values. See Figure 8.



Figure 8

We can observe that the graph extends horizontally from \[-5\] to the right without bound, so the domain is \[[-5, \infty)\]. The vertical extent of the graph is all range values \[5\] and below, so the range is \[(-\infty, 5]\]. Note that the domain and range are always written from smaller to larger values, or from left to right for domain, and from the bottom of the graph to the top of the graph for range.

## Example 6:  Finding Domain and Range from a Graph

Find the domain and range of the function \(f\) whose graph is shown in Figure 9



Figure 9

Solution

We can observe that the horizontal extent of the graph is –3 to 1, so the domain of \(f\) is \[(-3,1).\]

The vertical extent of the graph is 0 to –4, so the range is \[[-4,0].\] See Figure 10.

## Example 7:  Finding Domain and Range from a Graph of Oil Production

Find the domain and range of the function \(f\) whose graph is shown in Figure 11.



Figure 11 (credit: modification of work by the U.S. Energy Information Administration)4

Solution

The input quantity along the horizontal axis is “years,” which we represent with the variable \(t\) for time. The output quantity is “thousands of barrels of oil per day,” which we represent with the variable \(b\) for barrels. The graph may continue to the left and right beyond what is viewed, but based on the portion of the graph that is visible, we can determine the domain as \(1973 \leq t \leq 2008\) and the range as approximately \(180 \leq b \leq 2010.\)

In interval notation, the domain is [1973, 2008], and the range is about [180, 2010]. For the domain and the range, we approximate the smallest and largest values since they do not fall exactly on the grid lines.

1228_concept_1,concept,1228,"# Finding Domains and Ranges of the Toolkit Functions

We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to determine the domain and range of each.



Figure 13: For the constant function \[f(x) = c,\] the domain consists of all real numbers; there are no restrictions on the input. The only output value is the constant \[c,\] so the range is the set \[\{c\}\] that contains this single element. In interval notation, this is written as \[[c, c],\] the interval that both begins and ends with \[c.\]



**Figure 14:** For the **identity function** \[f(x) = x,\] there is no restriction on \[x.\] Both the domain and range are the set of all real numbers.



Figure 15: For the absolute value function \[f(x) = |x|,\] there is no restriction on \[x.\] However, because absolute value is defined as a distance from 0, the output can only be greater than or equal to 0.



Figure 16: For the quadratic function \[f(x) = x^2\], the domain is all real numbers since the horizontal extent of the graph is the whole real number line. Because the graph does not include any negative values for the range, the range is only nonnegative real numbers.



Figure 17: For the **cubic function** \[f(x) = x^3\], the domain is all real numbers because the horizontal extent of the graph is the whole real number line. The same applies to the vertical extent of the graph, so the domain and range include all real numbers.



Figure 18: For the **reciprocal function** \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\], we cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain. Further, 1 divided by any value can never be 0, so the range also will not include 0. In set-builder notation, we could also write \[\{x | x ≠ 0\}\], the set of all real numbers that are not zero.



Figure 19: For the **reciprocal squared function** \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}\], we cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain. There is also no x that can give an output of 0, so 0 is excluded from the range as well. Note that the output of this function is always positive due to the square in the denominator, so the range includes only positive numbers.



Figure 20: For the **square root function** \[f(x) = \sqrt{x}\], we cannot take the square root of a negative real number, so the domain must be 0 or greater. The range also excludes negative numbers because the square root of a positive number \[x\] is defined to be positive, even though the square of the negative number \[-\sqrt{x}\] also gives us \[x\].



**Figure 21**: For the cube root function \[f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}\], the domain and range include all real numbers. Note that there is no problem taking a cube root, or any odd-integer root, of a negative number, and the resulting output is negative (it is an odd function).

**How To**

**Given the formula for a function, determine the domain and range.**

1. Exclude from the domain any input values that result in division by zero.
2. Exclude from the domain any input values that have nonreal (or undefined) number outputs.
3. Use the valid input values to determine the range of the output values.
4. Look at the function graph and table values to confirm the actual function behavior.

## Example 8:  Finding the Domain and Range Using Toolkit Functions

Find the domain and range of \[f(x) = 2x^3 - x.\]

## Solution

There are no restrictions on the domain, as any real number may be cubed and then subtracted from the result.

The domain is \[(-\infty, \infty)\] and the range is also \[(-\infty, \infty).\]

## Example 9:  Finding the Domain and Range 

Find the domain and range of \[f(x) = \frac{2}{x+1}\]

Solution

We cannot evaluate the function at \[-1\] because division by zero is undefined. The domain is \[(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1, \infty)\] Because the function is never zero, we exclude 0 from the range. The range is \[(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)\]

## Example 10:  Finding the Domain and Range 

Find the domain and range of \[f(x) = 2\sqrt{x + 4}\].

Solution

We cannot take the square root of a negative number, so the value inside the radical must be nonnegative. \[x + 4 \geq 0\] when \(x \geq -4\).

The domain of \(f(x)\) is \[-4, \infty)\].

We then find the range. We know that \(f(-4) = 0\), and the function value increases as \(x\) increases without any upper limit. We conclude that the range of \(f\) is \[0, \infty)\].

Analysis 

Figure 22 represents the function \(f\).

1229_concept_1,concept,1229,"# Graphing Piecewise-Defined Functions

Sometimes, we come across a function that requires more than one formula in order to obtain the given output. For example, in the toolkit functions, we introduced the absolute value function \[f(x) = |x|\]. With a domain of all real numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, absolute value can be defined as the magnitude, or modulus, of a real number value regardless of sign. It is the distance from 0 on the number line. All of these definitions require the output to be greater than or equal to 0.

If we input 0, or a positive value, the output is the same as the input.

\[f(x) = x \text{ if } x \geq 0\]

If we input a negative value, the output is the opposite of the input.

\[f(x) = -x \quad if \quad x < 0\]

Because this requires two different processes or pieces, the absolute value function is an example of a piecewise function. A piecewise function is a function in which more than one formula is used to define the output over different pieces of the domain.

We use piecewise functions to describe situations in which a rule or relationship changes as the input value crosses certain “boundaries.” For example, we often encounter situations in business for which the cost per piece of a certain item is discounted once the number ordered exceeds a certain value. Tax brackets are another real-world example of piecewise functions. For example, consider a simple tax system in which incomes up to $10,000 are taxed at 10%, and any additional income is taxed at 20%. The tax on a total income \[S\] would be \[0.1S\] if \[S ≤ $10,000\] and \[$1000 + 0.2(S - $10,000)\] if \[S > $10,000.\]

### Piecewise Function

A **piecewise function** is a function in which more than one formula is used to define the output. Each formula has its own domain, and the domain of the function is the union of all these smaller domains. We notate this idea like this:

\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
formula 1 & \text{if } x \text{ is in domain 1} \\
formula 2 & \text{if } x \text{ is in domain 2} \\
formula 3 & \text{if } x \text{ is in domain 3} 
\end{cases}
\]

In piecewise notation, the absolute value function is

\[
|x| = 
\begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}
\]

**How To**

Given a piecewise function, write the formula and identify the domain for each interval.

1. Identify the intervals for which different rules apply.
2. Determine formulas that describe how to calculate an output from an input in each interval.
3. Use braces and if-statements to write the function.

# Example 11:  Writing a Piecewise Function

A museum charges $5 per person for a guided tour with a group of 1 to 9 people or a fixed $50 fee for a group of 10 or more people. Write a function relating the number of people, \[n,\] to the cost, \[C.\]

Solution

Two different formulas will be needed. For n-values under 10, \[C=5n.\] For values of \[n\] that are 10 or greater, \[C=50.\]

\[
C(n)=
\begin{cases} 
5n & \text{if } 0\lt n \lt 10 \\
50 & \text{if } n≥10 
\end{cases}
\]

Analysis 

The function is represented in Figure 23. The graph is a diagonal line from \[n=0\] to \[n=10\] and a constant after that. In this example, the two formulas agree at the meeting point where \[n=10,\] but not all piecewise functions have this property.



Figure 23

## Example 12:  # Working with a Piecewise Function

A cell phone company uses the function below to determine the cost, \(C\), in dollars for \(g\) gigabytes of data transfer.

\[
C(g) = 
\begin{cases} 
25 & \text{if } 0 \lt g \lt 2 \\
25 + 10(g - 2) & \text{if } g \geq 2 
\end{cases}
\]

Find the cost of using 1.5 gigabytes of data and the cost of using 4 gigabytes of data.

## Solution

To find the cost of using 1.5 gigabytes of data, \(C(1.5)\), we first look to see which part of the domain our input falls in. Because 1.5 is less than 2, we use the first formula.

\[
C(1.5) = $25
\]

To find the cost of using 4 gigabytes of data, \(C(4)\), we see that our input of 4 is greater than 2, so we use the second formula.

\[
C(4) = 25 + 10(4 - 2) = $45
\]

## Analysis

The function is represented in Figure 24. We can see where the function changes from a constant to a shifted and stretched identity at \(g = 2\). We plot the graphs for the different formulas on a common set of axes, making sure each formula is applied on its proper domain.



Figure 24

**How To**

**Given a piecewise function, sketch a graph.**

1. Indicate on the x-axis the boundaries defined by the intervals on each piece of the domain.
2. For each piece of the domain, graph on that interval using the corresponding equation pertaining to that piece.  Do not graph two functions over one interval because it would violate the criteria of a function.

## Example 13:  Graphing a Piecewise Function

Sketch a graph of the function.

\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
x^2 & \text{if } x \leq 1 \\
3 & \text{if } 1 < x \leq 2 \\
x & \text{if } x > 2 
\end{cases}
\]

**Solution**

Each of the component functions is from our library of toolkit functions, so we know their shapes. We can imagine graphing each function and then limiting the graph to the indicated domain. At the endpoints of the domain, we draw open circles to indicate where the endpoint is not included because of a less-than or greater-than inequality; we draw a closed circle where the endpoint is included because of a less-than-or-equal-to or greater-than-or-equal-to inequality. Figure 25 shows the three components of the piecewise function graphed on separate coordinate systems.



Figure 25: (a) \(f(x) = x^2\) if \(x \leq 1\); (b) \(f(x) = 3\) if \(1 \lt x \leq 2\); (c) \(f(x) = x\) if \(x > 2\)

Now that we have sketched each piece individually, we combine them in the same coordinate plane. See Figure 26.



Figure 26

**Analysis**

Note that the graph does pass the vertical line test even at \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\) because the points (1,3) and (2,2) are not part of the graph of the function, though (1,1) and (2,3) are.

**Q&A**

**Can more than one formula from a piecewise function be applied to a value in the domain?**

No. Each value corresponds to one equation in a piecewise formula.

# Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs

### Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:

- Find the average rate of change of a function.
- Use a graph to determine where a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.
- Use a graph to locate local maxima and local minima.
- Use a graph to locate the absolute maximum and absolute minimum.

Gasoline costs have experienced some wild fluctuations over the last several decades. [Table 1](#Table_01_03_01) lists the average cost, in dollars, of a gallon of gasoline for the years 2005–2012. The cost of gasoline can be considered as a function of year.

5 http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0524. Accessed 3/5/2014.

| **\[y\]** | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\[C(y)\]** | 2.31 | 2.62 | 2.84 | 3.30 | 2.41 | 2.84 | 3.58 | 3.68 |

Table 1

If we were interested only in how the gasoline prices changed between 2005 and 2012, we could compute that the cost per gallon had increased from $2.31 to $3.68, an increase of $1.37. While this is interesting, it might be more useful to look at how much the price changed *per year*. In this section, we will investigate changes such as these.","[""http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0524.""]",Precalculus 2e,Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs,Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs,Functions
1231_concept_1,concept,1231,"# Finding the Average Rate of Change of a Function

The price change per year is a rate of change because it describes how an output quantity changes relative to the change in the input quantity. We can see that the price of gasoline in Table 1 did not change by the same amount each year, so the rate of change was not constant. If we use only the beginning and ending data, we would be finding the average rate of change over the specified period of time. To find the average rate of change, we divide the change in the output value by the change in the input value.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Average rate of change} &= \frac{\text{Change in output}}{\text{Change in input}} \\
&= \frac{Δy}{Δx}\\
&= \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\
&= \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
\end{align*}
\]

The Greek letter \[\Delta\] (delta) signifies the change in a quantity; we read the ratio as “delta-*y* over delta-*x*” or “the change in \[y\] divided by the change in \[x.\]” Occasionally we write \[\Delta f\] instead of \[\Delta y,\] which still represents the change in the function’s output value resulting from a change to its input value. It does not mean we are changing the function into some other function.

In our example, the gasoline price increased by $1.37 from 2005 to 2012. Over 7 years, the average rate of change was

\[ 
  \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\$1.37}{7 \text{ years}} \approx 0.196 \text{ dollars per year}
  \]


On average, the price of gas increased by about 19.6¢ each year.

Other examples of rates of change include:

- A population of rats increasing by 40 rats per week
- A car traveling 68 miles per hour (distance traveled changes by 68 miles each hour as time passes)
- A car driving 27 miles per gallon (distance traveled changes by 27 miles for each gallon)
- The current through an electrical circuit increasing by 0.125 amperes for every volt of increased voltage
- The amount of money in a college account decreasing by $4,000 per quarter

### Rate of Change

A rate of change describes how an output quantity changes relative to the change in the input quantity. The units on a rate of change are “output units per input units.”

The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of the function values (output values) divided by the change in the input values.

\[\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\]

**How To**

Given the value of a function at different points, calculate the average rate of change of a function for the interval between two values \[x_1\] and \[x_2\].

1. Calculate the difference \[y_2 - y_1 = \Delta y\].
2. Calculate the difference \[x_2 - x_1 = \Delta x\].
3. Find the ratio \[\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\].

## Example 1:  Computing an Average Rate of Change

Using the data in Table 1, find the average rate of change of the price of gasoline between 2007 and 2009.

Solution

In 2007, the price of gasoline was $2.84. In 2009, the cost was $2.41. The average rate of change is

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{Δy}{Δx} &= \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\
&= \frac{\$2.41 - \$2.84}{2009 - 2007} \\
&= \frac{- \$0.43}{2 \text{ years}} \\
&= - \$0.22 \text{ per year}
\end{align*}
\]

Analysis

Note that a decrease is expressed by a negative change or “negative increase.” A rate of change is negative when the output decreases as the input increases or when the output increases as the input decreases.

## Example 2:  Computing Average Rate of Change from a Graph

Given the function \(g(t)\) shown in Figure 1, find the average rate of change on the interval \([-1,2]\).



Figure 1

Solution

At \(t=-1\), Figure 2 shows \(g(-1)=4\). At \(t=2\), the graph shows \(g(2)=1\).



Figure 2

The horizontal change \(\Delta t = 3\) is shown by the red arrow, and the vertical change \(\Delta g(t) = -3\) is shown by the turquoise arrow. The average rate of change is shown by the slope of the orange line segment. The output changes by –3 while the input changes by 3, giving an average rate of change of

\[
\frac{1-4}{2-(-1)} = \frac{-3}{3} = -1
\]

Analysis

Note that the order we choose is very important. If, for example, we use \(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_1 - x_2}\), we will not get the correct answer. Decide which point will be 1 and which point will be 2, and keep the coordinates fixed as \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).

## Example 3:  Computing Average Rate of Change from a Table

After picking up a friend who lives 10 miles away and leaving on a trip, Anna records her distance from home over time. The values are shown in Table 2. Find her average speed over the first 6 hours.

| t (hours) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D(t) (miles) | 10 | 55 | 90 | 153 | 214 | 240 | 292 | 300 |

Table 2

Solution

Here, the average speed is the average rate of change. She traveled 282 miles in 6 hours.

\[
\frac{292 - 10}{6 - 0} = \frac{282}{6} = 47
\]

The average speed is 47 miles per hour.

Analysis

Because the speed is not constant, the average speed depends on the interval chosen. For the interval [2,3], the average speed is 63 miles per hour.

## Example 4:  Computing Average Rate of Change for a Function Expressed as a Formula

Compute the average rate of change of \[f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{x}\] on the interval \[[2, 4]\].

Solution

We can start by computing the function values at each endpoint of the interval.

\[
\begin{align*}
f(2) &= 2^2 - \frac{1}{2} \ \ \ \ \ & f(4) &=  4^2 - \frac{1}{4} \\
& = 4 - \frac{1}{2} & &= 16 - \frac{1}{4} \\
& = \frac{7}{2} &  &= \frac{63}{4}
\end{align*}
\]


Now we compute the average rate of change.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Average rate of change} &= \frac{f(4) - f(2)}{4 - 2} \\
&= \frac{\frac{63}{4} - \frac{7}{2}}{4 - 2} \\
&= \frac{\frac{49}{4}}{2} \\
&= \frac{49}{8}
\end{align*}
\]

# Example 5:  Finding the Average Rate of Change of a Force

The electrostatic force \(F,\) measured in newtons, between two charged particles can be related to the distance between the particles \(d,\) in centimeters, by the formula \(F(d) = \frac{2}{d^2}\). Find the average rate of change of force if the distance between the particles is increased from 2 cm to 6 cm.

## Solution

We are computing the average rate of change of \(F(d) = \frac{2}{d^2}\) on the interval \[2,6\].

The solution is as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Average rate of change} &= \frac{F(6) - F(2)}{6 - 2} \\
&= \frac{\frac{2}{6^2} - \frac{2}{2^2}}{6 - 2} & \text{Simplify.}\\
&= \frac{\frac{2}{36} - \frac{2}{4}}{4} \\
&= \frac{-\frac{16}{36}}{4} & \text{Combine numerator terms.} \\
& = -\frac{1}{9} & \text{Simplify.}
\end{align*}
\]


The average rate of change is \(-\frac{1}{9}\) newton per centimeter.

# Example 6: Finding an Average Rate of Change as an Expression

Find the average rate of change of \(g(t) = t^2 + 3t + 1\) on the interval \[0, a\]. The answer will be an expression involving \(a\) in simplest form.

## Solution

We use the average rate of change formula.

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\text{Average rate of change} & = & \frac{g(a) - g(0)}{a - 0} &\text{ Evaluate.} \\
& = & \frac{(a^2 + 3a + 1) - (0^2 + 3(0) + 1)}{a - 0} &\text{ Simplify.} \\
& = & \frac{a^2 + 3a + 1 - 1}{a} &\text{ Simplify and factor.} \\
& = & \frac{a(a + 3)}{a} &\text{ Divide by the common factor } a. \\
& = & a + 3
\end{array}
\]

This result tells us the average rate of change in terms of \(a\) between \(t = 0\) and any other point \(t = a\). For example, on the interval \[0, 5\], the average rate of change would be \(5 + 3 = 8\).","[""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/4addfb74253fce4ae55412711a1434f9f9e51e3c"", ""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/d84ed64dc26251db8331b52317e22b52fe8311bb""]",Precalculus 2e,Finding the Average Rate of Change of a Function,Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs,Functions

As part of exploring how functions change, we can identify intervals over which the function is changing in specific ways. We say that a function is increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the input values increase within that interval. Similarly, a function is decreasing on an interval if the function values decrease as the input values increase over that interval. The average rate of change of an increasing function is positive, and the average rate of change of a decreasing function is negative. Figure 3 shows examples of increasing and decreasing intervals on a function.



Figure 3: The function \[f(x) = x^3 - 12x\] is increasing on \[(-\infty, -2) \cup (2, \infty)\] and is decreasing on \[(-2, 2).\]

While some functions are increasing (or decreasing) over their entire domain, many others are not. A value of the input where a function changes from increasing to decreasing (as we go from left to right, that is, as the input variable increases) is the location of a local maximum. The function value at that point is the local maximum. If a function has more than one, we say it has local maxima. Similarly, a value of the input where a function changes from decreasing to increasing as the input variable increases is the location of a local minimum. The function value at that point is the local minimum. The plural form is “local minima.” Together, local maxima and minima are called local extrema, or local extreme values, of the function. (The singular form is “extremum.”) Often, the term local is replaced by the term relative. In this text, we will use the term local.

Clearly, a function is neither increasing nor decreasing on an interval where it is constant. A function is also neither increasing nor decreasing at extrema. Note that we have to speak of local extrema, because any given local extremum as defined here is not necessarily the highest maximum or lowest minimum in the function’s entire domain.

For the function whose graph is shown in Figure 4, the local maximum is 16, and it occurs at \[x = -2.\] The local minimum is \[-16\] and it occurs at \[x = 2.\]



Figure 4

To locate the local maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the graph to determine where the graph attains its highest and lowest points, respectively, within an open interval. Like the summit of a roller coaster, the graph of a function is higher at a local maximum than at nearby points on both sides. The graph will also be lower at a local minimum than at neighboring points. Figure 5 illustrates these ideas for a local maximum.



Figure 5: Definition of a local maximum

These observations lead us to a formal definition of local extrema.

# Local Minima and Local Maxima

A function \(f\) is an increasing function on an open interval if \(f(b) > f(a)\) for any two input values \(a\) and \(b\) in the given interval where \(b > a\).

A function \(f\) is a decreasing function on an open interval if \(f(b) \lt f(a)\) for any two input values \(a\) and \(b\) in the given interval where \(b > a\).

A function \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x = b\) if there exists an interval \((a, c)\) with \(a < b < c\) such that, for any \(x\) in the interval \((a, c)\), \(f(x) ≤ f(b)\). Likewise, \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x = b\) if there exists an interval \((a, c)\) with \(a < b < c\) such that, for any \(x\) in the interval \((a, c)\), \(f(x) ≥ f(b)\).

## Example 7:  Finding Increasing and Decreasing Intervals on a Graph

Given the function \[p(t)\] in Figure 6, identify the intervals on which the function appears to be increasing.



Figure 6

## Solution

We see that the function is not constant on any interval. The function is increasing where it slants upward as we move to the right and decreasing where it slants downward as we move to the right. The function appears to be increasing from \[t = 1\] to \[t = 3\] and from \[t = 4\] on.

In interval notation, we would say the function appears to be increasing on the interval (1,3) and the interval \[(4, ∞).\]

## Analysis

Notice in this example that we used open intervals (intervals that do not include the endpoints), because the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at \[t = 1\] , \[t = 3\] , and \[t = 4\] . These points are the local extrema (two minima and a maximum).

## Example 8:  Finding Local Extrema from a Graph

Graph the function \[f(x) = \frac{2}{x} + \frac{x}{3}\]. Then use the graph to estimate the local extrema of the function and to determine the intervals on which the function is increasing.

# Solution

Using technology, we find that the graph of the function looks like that in Figure 7. It appears there is a low point, or local minimum, between \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3,\) and a mirror-image high point, or local maximum, somewhere between \(x = -3\) and \(x = -2.\)



Figure 7

# Analysis

Most graphing calculators and graphing utilities can estimate the location of maxima and minima. Figure 8 provides screen images from two different technologies, showing the estimate for the local maximum and minimum.



Figure 8

Based on these estimates, the function is increasing on the interval \((-∞, -2.449)\) and \((2.449, ∞)\). Notice that, while we expect the extrema to be symmetric, the two different technologies agree only up to four decimals due to the differing approximation algorithms used by each. (The exact location of the extrema is at \(±\sqrt{6},\) but determining this requires calculus.)

For the function \(f\) whose graph is shown in Figure 9, find all local maxima and minima.

There is a difference between locating the highest and lowest points on a graph in a region around an open interval (locally) and locating the highest and lowest points on the graph for the entire domain. The \[y-\] coordinates (output) at the highest and lowest points are called the **absolute maximum** and **absolute minimum**, respectively.

To locate absolute maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the graph to determine where the graph attains it highest and lowest points on the domain of the function. See Figure 13.



Figure 13

Not every function has an absolute maximum or minimum value. The toolkit function \(f(x) = x^3\) is one such function.

### Absolute Maxima and Minima

The absolute maximum of \(f\) at \(x = c\) is \(f(c)\) where \(f(c) \geq f(x)\) for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f\).

The absolute minimum of \(f\) at \(x = d\) is \(f(d)\) where \(f(d) \leq f(x)\) for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f\).

# Example 10

For the function \(f\) shown in Figure 14, find all absolute maxima and minima.



## Solution
Observe the graph of \(f\). The graph attains an absolute maximum in two locations, \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2,\) because at these locations, the graph attains its highest point on the domain of the function. The absolute maximum is the \[y\]-coordinate at \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2,\) which is \(16.\)

The graph attains an absolute minimum at \(x = 3,\) because it is the lowest point on the domain of the function’s graph. The absolute minimum is the \[y\]-coordinate at \(x = 3,\) which is \(-10.\)

# Composition of Functions

### Learning Objectives
In this section, you will:

- Combine functions using algebraic operations.
- Create a new function by composition of functions.
- Evaluate composite functions.
- Find the domain of a composite function.
- Decompose a composite function into its component functions.

Suppose we want to calculate how much it costs to heat a house on a particular day of the year. The cost to heat a house will depend on the average daily temperature, and in turn, the average daily temperature depends on the particular day of the year. Notice how we have just defined two relationships: The cost depends on the temperature, and the temperature depends on the day.

Using descriptive variables, we can notate these two functions. The function \[C(T)\] gives the cost \[C\] of heating a house for a given average daily temperature in \[T\] degrees Celsius. The function \[T(d)\] gives the average daily temperature on day \[d\] of the year. For any given day, \[Cost = C(T(d))\] means that the cost depends on the temperature, which in turns depends on the day of the year. Thus, we can evaluate the cost function at the temperature \[T(d).\] For example, we could evaluate \[T(5)\] to determine the average daily temperature on the 5th day of the year. Then, we could evaluate the cost function at that temperature. We would write \[C(T(5)).\]



By combining these two relationships into one function, we have performed function composition, which is the focus of this section.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20230828.164620/resources/336d97bc881544921ca4876a504752b89148f9fd""]",Precalculus 2e,Composition of Functions,Composition of Functions,Functions
1236_concept_1,concept,1236,"# Combining Functions Using Algebraic Operations

Function composition is only one way to combine existing functions. Another way is to carry out the usual algebraic operations on functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We do this by performing the operations with the function outputs, defining the result as the output of our new function.

Suppose we need to add two columns of numbers that represent a husband and wife’s separate annual incomes over a period of years, with the result being their total household income. We want to do this for every year, adding only that year’s incomes and then collecting all the data in a new column. If \[w(y)\] is the wife’s income and \[h(y)\] is the husband’s income in year \[y,\] and we want \[T\] to represent the total income, then we can define a new function.

\[T(y) = h(y) + w(y)\]

If this holds true for every year, then we can focus on the relation between the functions without reference to a year and write

\[T = h + w\]

Just as for this sum of two functions, we can define difference, product, and ratio functions for any pair of functions that have the same kinds of inputs (not necessarily numbers) and also the same kinds of outputs (which do have to be numbers so that the usual operations of algebra can apply to them, and which also must have the same units or no units when we add and subtract). In this way, we can think of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing functions.

For two functions \[f(x)\] and \[g(x)\] with real number outputs, we define new functions \[f+g, f−g, fg,\] and \[\frac{f}{g}\] by the relations

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
(f+g)(x) & = & f(x) + g(x) \\
(f-g)(x) & = & f(x) - g(x) \\
(fg)(x) & = & f(x)g(x) \\
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x) & = & \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \quad 
\end{array}
\]

## Example 1:  Performing Algebraic Operations on Functions

Find and simplify the functions \[(g - f)(x)\] and \[\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x)\], given \[f(x) = x - 1\] and \[g(x) = x^2 - 1.\] Are they the same function?

Solution

Begin by writing the general form, and then substitute the given functions.

\[
\begin{align*}
(g - f)(x) &= g(x) - f(x) \\
(g - f)(x) &= x^2 - 1 - (x - 1) \\
(g - f)(x) &= x^2 - x \\
(g - f)(x) &= x(x - 1) \\
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x) &= \frac{g(x)}{f(x)} \\
\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x) &= \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\
\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x) &= \frac{(x + 1)(x - 1)}{x - 1} \quad \text{where } x \neq 1 \\
\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x) &= x + 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

No, the functions are not the same.

Note: For \[\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x)\], the condition \[x \neq 1\] is necessary because when \[x = 1\], the denominator is equal to 0, which makes the function undefined.",[],Precalculus 2e,Combining Functions Using Algebraic Operations,Composition of Functions,Functions
1237_concept_1,concept,1237,"# Create a Function by Composition of Functions

Performing algebraic operations on functions combines them into a new function, but we can also create functions by composing functions. When we wanted to compute a heating cost from a day of the year, we created a new function that takes a day as input and yields a cost as output. The process of combining functions so that the output of one function becomes the input of another is known as a composition of functions. The resulting function is known as a **composite function**. We represent this combination by the following notation:

\[(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))\]

We read the left-hand side as \[f\] composed with \[g\] at \[x,\] and the right-hand side as \[f\] of \[g\] of \[x.\] The two sides of the equation have the same mathematical meaning and are equal. The open circle symbol \[∘\] is called the composition operator. We use this operator mainly when we wish to emphasize the relationship between the functions themselves without referring to any particular input value. Composition is a binary operation that takes two functions and forms a new function, much as addition or multiplication takes two numbers and gives a new number. However, it is important not to confuse function composition with multiplication because, as we learned above, in most cases \[f(g(x)) ≠ f(x)g(x).\]

It is also important to understand the order of operations in evaluating a composite function. We follow the usual convention with parentheses by starting with the innermost parentheses first, and then working to the outside. In the equation above, the function \(g\) takes the input \(x\) first and yields an output \(g(x)\). Then the function \(f\) takes \(g(x)\) as an input and yields an output \(f(g(x))\).



In general, \(f \circ g\) and \(g \circ f\) are different functions. In other words, in many cases \(f(g(x)) \neq g(f(x))\) for all \(x.\) We will also see that sometimes two functions can be composed only in one specific order.

For example, if \(f(x) = x^2\) and \(g(x) = x + 2\), then

\[
\begin{align*}
f(g(x)) &= f(x+2) \\
&= (x+2)^2 \\
&= x^2 + 4x + 4
\end{align*}
\]

but

\[
\begin{align*}
g(f(x)) &= g(x^2) \\
&= x^2 + 2
\end{align*}
\]

These expressions are not equal for all values of \[x,\] so the two functions are not equal. It is irrelevant that the expressions happen to be equal for the single input value \[x = -\frac{1}{2}.\]

Note that the range of the inside function (the first function to be evaluated) needs to be within the domain of the outside function. Less formally, the composition has to make sense in terms of inputs and outputs.

# Composition of Functions

When the output of one function is used as the input of another, we call the entire operation a composition of functions. For any input \(x\) and functions \(f\) and \(g,\) this action defines a composite function, which we write as \(f \circ g\) such that

\[(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))\]

The domain of the composite function \(f \circ g\) is all \(x\) such that \(x\) is in the domain of \(g\) and \(g(x)\) is in the domain of \(f.\)

It is important to realize that the product of functions \(fg\) is not the same as the function composition \(f(g(x)),\) because, in general, \(f(x)g(x) \neq f(g(x)).\)

# Example 2: Determining whether Composition of Functions is Commutative

Using the functions provided, find \[f(g(x))\] and \[g(f(x)).\] Determine whether the composition of the functions is commutative.

\[
f(x) = 2x + 1 \quad g(x) = 3 - x
\]

## Solution

Let’s begin by substituting \[g(x)\] into \[f(x).\]

\[
\begin{align*}
f(g(x)) &= 2(3 - x) + 1 \\
&= 6 - 2x + 1 \\
&= 7 - 2x
\end{align*}
\]

Now we can substitute \[f(x)\] into \[g(x).\]

\[
\begin{align*}
g(f(x)) &= 3 - (2x + 1) \\
&= 3 - 2x - 1 \\
&= -2x + 2
\end{align*}
\]

We find that \[g(f(x)) \neq f(g(x)),\] so the operation of function composition is not commutative.

# Example 3: Interpreting Composite Functions

The function \(c(s)\) gives the number of calories burned completing \(s\) sit-ups, and \(s(t)\) gives the number of sit-ups a person can complete in \(t\) minutes. Interpret \(c(s(3))\).

Solution

The inside expression in the composition is \(s(3)\). Because the input to the *s*-function is time, \(t=3\) represents 3 minutes, and \(s(3)\) is the number of sit-ups completed in 3 minutes. 

Using \(s(3)\) as the input to the function \(c(s)\) gives us the number of calories burned during the number of sit-ups that can be completed in 3 minutes, or simply the number of calories burned in 3 minutes (by doing sit-ups).

# Example 4:  Investigating the Order of Function Composition

Suppose \(f(x)\) gives miles that can be driven in \(x\) hours and \(g(y)\) gives the gallons of gas used in driving \(y\) miles. Which of these expressions is meaningful: \(f(g(y))\) or \(g(f(x))\)?

## Solution

The function \(y=f(x)\) is a function whose output is the number of miles driven corresponding to the number of hours driven. 

\[
\text{number of miles} = f \text{(number of hours)}
\]

The function \(g(y)\) is a function whose output is the number of gallons used corresponding to the number of miles driven. This means:

\[
\text{number of gallons} = g\text{(number of miles)}
\]

The expression \(g(y)\) takes miles as the input and a number of gallons as the output. The function \(f(x)\) requires a number of hours as the input. Trying to input a number of gallons does not make sense. The expression \(f(g(y))\) is meaningless.

The expression \(f(x)\) takes hours as input and a number of miles driven as the output. The function \(g(y)\) requires a number of miles as the input. Using \(f(x)\) (miles driven) as an input value for \(g(y)\), where gallons of gas depends on miles driven, does make sense. The expression \(g(f(x))\) makes sense, and will yield the number of gallons of gas used, \(g\), driving a certain number of miles, \(f(x)\), in \(x\) hours.

Q&A

Are there any situations where \[f(g(y))\] and \[g(f(x))\] would both be meaningful or useful expressions?

Yes. For many pure mathematical functions, both compositions make sense, even though they usually produce different new functions. In real-world problems, functions whose inputs and outputs have the same units also may give compositions that are meaningful in either order.","[""https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/c02500912de8e653c7e833a6aa2d53696a4c7630""]",Precalculus 2e,Create a Function by Composition of Functions,Composition of Functions,Functions
1238_concept_1,concept,1238,"# Evaluating Composite Functions

Once we compose a new function from two existing functions, we need to be able to evaluate it for any input in its domain. We will do this with specific numerical inputs for functions expressed as tables, graphs, and formulas and with variables as inputs to functions expressed as formulas. In each case, we evaluate the inner function using the starting input and then use the inner function’s output as the input for the outer function.

## Evaluating Composite Functions Using Tables

When working with functions given as tables, we read input and output values from the table entries and always work from the inside to the outside. We evaluate the inside function first and then use the output of the inside function as the input to the outside function.

### Example 5: Using a Table to Evaluate a Composite Function

Using Table 1, evaluate \[f(g(3))\] and \[g(f(3)).\]

| x | f(x) | g(x) |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | 6    | 3    |
| 2 | 8    | 5    |
| 3 | 3    | 2    |
| 4 | 1    | 7    |

**Table 1**

**Solution**

To evaluate \[f(g(3)),\] we start from the inside with the input value 3. We then evaluate the inside expression \[g(3)\] using the table that defines the function \[g:\] \[g(3)=2.\] We can then use that result as the input to the function \[f,\] so \[g(3)\] is replaced by 2 and we get \[f(2).\] Then, using the table that defines the function \[f,\] we find that \[f(2)=8.\]

\[
\begin{align*}
g(3) &= 2 \\
f(g(3)) &= f(2) = 8
\end{align*}
\]

To evaluate \[g(f(3)),\] we first evaluate the inside expression \[f(3)\] using the first table: \[f(3)=3.\] Then, using the table for \[g, \] we can evaluate

\[
g(f(3)) = g(3) = 2
\]

Table 2 shows the composite functions \[f \circ g\] and \[g \circ f\] as tables.

| x | g(x) | f(g(x)) | f(x) | g(f(x)) |
|---|------|---------|------|---------|
| 3 | 2    | 8       | 3    | 2       |

**Table 2**

## Evaluating Composite Functions Using Graphs

When we are given individual functions as graphs, the procedure for evaluating composite functions is similar to the process we use for evaluating tables. We read the input and output values, but this time, from the \[x-\] and \[y-\] axes of the graphs.

**How To**

Given a composite function and graphs of its individual functions, evaluate it using the information provided by the graphs.

1. Locate the given input to the inner function on the \[x-\] axis of its graph.
2. Read off the output of the inner function from the \[y-\] axis of its graph.
3. Locate the inner function output on the \[x-\] axis of the graph of the outer function.
4. Read the output of the outer function from the \[y-\] axis of its graph. This is the output of the composite function.

### Example 6:  Using a Graph to Evaluate a Composite Function

Using Figure 1, evaluate \[f(g(1)).\]



Figure 1

# Solution

To evaluate \[f(g(1)),\] we start with the inside evaluation. See Figure 2.



Figure 2

We evaluate \[g(1)\] using the graph of \[g(x),\] finding the input of 1 on the \[x-\] axis and finding the output value of the graph at that input. Here, \[g(1)=3.\] We use this value as the input to the function \[f.\]

\[
f(g(1))=f(3)
\]

We can then evaluate the composite function by looking to the graph of \[f(x),\] finding the input of 3 on the \[x-\] axis and reading the output value of the graph at this input. Here, \[f(3)=6,\] so \[f(g(1))=6.\]

# Analysis 

Figure 3 shows how we can mark the graphs with arrows to trace the path from the input value to the output value.



Figure 3

## Evaluating Composite Functions Using Formulas

When evaluating a composite function where we have either created or been given formulas, the rule of working from the inside out remains the same. The input value to the outer function will be the output of the inner function, which may be a numerical value, a variable name, or a more complicated expression.

While we can compose the functions for each individual input value, it is sometimes helpful to find a single formula that will calculate the result of a composition \[f(g(x)).\] To do this, we will extend our idea of function evaluation. Recall that, when we evaluate a function like \[f(t) = t^2 - t,\] we substitute the value inside the parentheses into the formula wherever we see the input variable.

**How To**

**Given a formula for a composite function, evaluate the function.**

1. Evaluate the inside function using the input value or variable provided.
2. Use the resulting output as the input to the outside function.

### Example 7:  Evaluating a Composition of Functions Expressed as Formulas with a Numerical Input

Given \(f(t) = t^2 - t\) and \(h(x) = 3x + 2\), evaluate \(f(h(1))\).

Solution

Because the inside expression is \(h(1)\), we start by evaluating \(h(x)\) at 1.

\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
h(1) & = & 3(1) + 2 \\
h(1) &=&  5 \\
\end{array}
\]

Then \(f(h(1)) = f(5)\), so we evaluate \(f(t)\) at an input of 5.

\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
f(h(1)) & =&  f(5) \\
f(h(1)) &= & 5^2 - 5 \\
f(h(1)) &=&  20 
\end{array}
\]

1239_concept_1,concept,1239,"# Finding the Domain of a Composite Function

As we discussed previously, the domain of a composite function such as \[f \circ g\] is dependent on the domain of \[g\] and the domain of \[f.\] It is important to know when we can apply a composite function and when we cannot, that is, to know the domain of a function such as \[f \circ g.\] Let us assume we know the domains of the functions \[f\] and \[g\] separately. If we write the composite function for an input \[x\] as \[f(g(x)),\] we can see right away that \[x\] must be a member of the domain of \[g\] in order for the expression to be meaningful, because otherwise we cannot complete the inner function evaluation. However, we also see that \[g(x)\] must be a member of the domain of \[f,\] otherwise the second function evaluation in \[f(g(x))\] cannot be completed, and the expression is still undefined. Thus the domain of \[f \circ g\] consists of only those inputs in the domain of \[g\] that produce outputs from \[g\] belonging to the domain of \[f.\] Note that the domain of \[f\] composed with \[g\] is the set of all \[x\] such that \[x\] is in the domain of \[g\] and \[g(x)\] is in the domain of \[f.\]

### Domain of a Composite Function

The domain of a composite function \[f(g(x))\] is the set of those inputs \[x\] in the domain of \[g\] for which \[g(x)\] is in the domain of \[f.\]

**How To**

**Given a function composition \[f(g(x)),\] determine its domain.**

1. Find the domain of \[g.\]
2. Find the domain of \[f.\]
3. Find those inputs \[x\] in the domain of \[g\] for which \[g(x)\] is in the domain of \[f.\] That is, exclude those inputs \[x\] from the domain of \[g\] for which \[g(x)\] is not in the domain of \[f.\] The resulting set is the domain of \[f \circ g.\]

## Example 8:  Finding the Domain of a Composite Function

Find the domain of

\[(f \circ g)(x)\] where \(f(x) = \frac{5}{x - 1}\) and \(g(x) = \frac{4}{3x - 2}\)

Solution

The domain of \(g(x)\) consists of all real numbers except \(x = \frac{2}{3}\), since that input value would cause us to divide by 0. Likewise, the domain of \(f\) consists of all real numbers except 1. So we need to exclude from the domain of \(g(x)\) that value of \(x\) for which \(g(x) = 1\).

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{4}{3x - 2} &= 1 \\
4 &= 3x - 2 \\
6 &= 3x \\
x &= 2 \\
\end{align*}
\]

So the domain of \(f \circ g\) is the set of all real numbers except \(\frac{2}{3}\) and 2. This means that

\[x \neq \frac{2}{3} \text{ or } x \neq 2\]

We can write this in interval notation as

\[(-\infty, \frac{2}{3}) \cup (\frac{2}{3}, 2) \cup (2, \infty)\]

## Example 9:  Finding the Domain of a Composite Function Involving Radicals

Find the domain of

\[(f \circ g)(x) \text{ where } f(x) = \sqrt{x + 2} \text{ and } g(x) = \sqrt{3 - x}\]

Solution

Because we cannot take the square root of a negative number, the domain of \(g\) is \[(-\infty, 3]\]. Now we check the domain of the composite function

\[(f \circ g)(x) = \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} + 2}\]

For \[(f \circ g)(x) = \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} + 2}, \sqrt{3 - x} + 2 \geq 0\],

since the radicand of a square root must be positive. Since square roots are positive, \[\sqrt{3 - x} \geq 0\], or, \(3 - x \geq 0\), which gives a domain of \[(-\infty, 3]\].

Analysis

This example shows that knowledge of the range of functions (specifically the inner function) can also be helpful in finding the domain of a composite function. It also shows that the domain of \(f \circ g\) can contain values that are not in the domain of \(f\), though they must be in the domain of \(g\).",[],Precalculus 2e,Finding the Domain of a Composite Function,Composition of Functions,Functions

The range of the function \[h(a) = \sqrt{ba + c} - d\] is \[[-d,\infin)\] because the output of the square root function is always non-negative and we subtract d from it.

To show that every element in this set is in the range of \(f\), we need to show that for all \(y\) in this set, there exists a real number \(x\) in the domain such that \(f(x) = y\). Let \(y \geq -1\). Then, \(f(x) = y\) if and only if
   \[\sqrt{3x + 2} - 1 = y.\]
   Solving this equation for \(x\), we see that \(x\) must solve the equation
   \[\sqrt{3x + 2} = y + 1.\]
    \(3x + 2 = (y + 1)^2.\)
   \[x = \frac{1}{3}(y + 1)^2 - \frac{2}{3}.\]
   We just need to verify that \(x\) is in the domain of \(f\). Since the domain of \(f\) consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to \(-2/3\), and
   \[\frac{1}{3}(y + 1)^2 - \frac{2}{3} \geq -\frac{2}{3},\]
   there does exist an \(x\) in the domain of \(f\). We conclude that the range of \(f\) is \(\{y | y \geq -1\}\).

Since \[0 < \frac{1}{x^{2} + 1} \leq 1\], the range is, at most, the interval \[(0, 1]\]. To show that the range is this entire interval, we let \[y = \frac{1}{x^{2} + 1}\] and solve this equation for \[x\] to show that for all \[y\] in the interval \[(0, 1]\], there exists a real number \[x\] such that \[y = \frac{1}{x^{2} + 1}\]. Solving this equation for \[x\], we see that \[x^{2} + 1 = \frac{1}{y}\], which implies that

\[x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{y}-1}.\]

If \[y\] is in the interval \[(0, 1]\], the expression under the radical is nonnegative, and therefore there exists a real number \[x\] such that \[\frac{1}{x^{2} + 1} = y\]. We conclude that the range of \[(g \circ f)\] is the interval \[(0, 1]\].

What is the domain of the function \[f(b) = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2},\; (a>0)\]?

\[a \leq b \leq -a\]

\[-a \geq b \geq a\]

\[a \geq b \geq -a\]

\[-a \leq b \leq a\]

\[-a \leq b \leq a\]

The domain of the function \[f(b) = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}\] is 
 \[-a \leq b \leq a\]. This is because the square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system, so we need \[a^2 - b^2 \geq 0\], which reduces to \[-a \leq b \leq a\].

\[\sqrt{3} \leq x \leq -\sqrt{3}\]

\[-\sqrt{3} \leq x \leq \sqrt{3}\]

\[-\sqrt{3} \leq x \leq \sqrt{3}\]

The domain of the function \[f(x) = \sqrt{3 - x^2}\] is 
 \[- \sqrt{3}\leq x \leq \sqrt{3}\]. This is because the square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system, so we need \[3 - x^2 \geq 0\], which reduces to \[-\sqrt{3} \leq x \leq \sqrt{3}\].

If \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\), then \(0 \leq 4 - x^2 \leq 4\). Therefore, \(0 \leq \sqrt{4 - x^2} \leq 2\), and the range of \(f\) is \(\{0 \leq y \leq 2\}\).

What is the domain and range of the inverse of the function \[f(x) = (x + a)^3\]?

Domain: \[[-a, \infty)\], Range: \[[0, \infty)\]

Domain: \[(-a, \infty)\], Range: \[(0, \infty)\]

Domain: \[(0, \infty)\], Range: \[(-\infty, \infty)\]

Domain: \[(-\infty, \infty)\], Range: \[(-\infty, \infty)\]

Domain: \[(-\infty, \infty)\], Range: \[(-\infty, \infty)\]

The x-coordinate value lie in the interval \[(-\infty, \infty)\] so domain of the function is \[(-\infty, \infty)\] and y-coordinate value lie in the interval \[(-\infty, \infty)\] so range of the function is \[(-\infty, \infty)\]. The domain of the inverse function is the range of the original function, which is \[(-\infty, \infty)\].The range of the inverse function is the domain of the original function, which is \[(-\infty, \infty)\].

To find a formula for \(f^{-1}\), solve the equation \(y = (x + 1)^2\) for \(x\).
\(y = (x + 1)^2\)
Apply square root both sides and switch sides
 \(x+1= \pm \sqrt{y}\) 
 Subtract 1 from both sides
  \(x = -1 \pm \sqrt{y}\)

What is the first step in finding the inverse of a function?

Solve the equation for y.

Solve the equation for x.

Switch the variables x and y.

Apply the square root to both sides of the equation.

Solve the equation for x.

The first step in finding the inverse of a function is to solve the equation for x and then we interchange the variables x and y. This is because the inverse function 'undoes' the work of the original function, so we want to find an equation that will give us the original x-values when we input the y-values.

What is the isolated form of \[x\] in the equation \[\\y = (x + 2)^2\]?

\[x= -2 \pm \sqrt{y}\]

\[x= -2 + \sqrt{y}\]

\[x= -2 -\sqrt{y}\]

\[x=  2 -\sqrt{y}\]

\[x= -2 \pm \sqrt{y}\]

To isolate \[x\] in the equation \[y = (x + 2)^2\], we first apply square root both sides and then subtract \[2\] from both sides to get the value of \[x\].

difficult

What is the isolated form of \[x\] in the equation \[\\y = (x + a)^3\]?

\[x=  a +\sqrt[3]{y}\]

\[x= -a +\sqrt {y}\]

\[x= -a -\sqrt[3]{y}\]

\[x= -a +\sqrt[3]{y}\]

\[x= -a +\sqrt[3]{y}\]

To isolate \[x\] in the equation \[y = (x + a)^3\], we first apply cube root both sides and then subtract \[a\] from both sides to get the value of \[x\].

Interchange the variables \[x\] and \[y\] and write \[y=f^{-1}(x)\]
\(x = -1 \pm \sqrt{y}\) (two values for \(x\))
Since we are restricting the domain to the interval where \(x \geq -1\), we need \(\pm \sqrt{y} \geq 0\). Therefore, \(x = -1 + \sqrt{y}.\\\)Interchanging \(x\) and \(y\), we write \(y = -1 + \sqrt{x}\) and conclude that \(f^{-1}(x) = -1 + \sqrt{x}\).

easy

What does it mean to interchange the variables x and y in a function?

Swap the positions of x and y in the equation.

Change the x-values to y-values and the y-values to x-values.

Replace all x's with y's and all y's with x's.

Change the function to its inverse.

Swap the positions of x and y in the equation.

Interchanging the variables x and y in a function means to swap the positions of x and y in the equation. This is often done when finding the inverse of a function.

medium

What is the correct value of x when \[x= -2 \pm \sqrt{y}\] and restricted domain is \[[-2, \infty)\]?

\[x= -2 \pm \sqrt{y}\]

\[x= -2 + \sqrt{y}\]

\[x= -2 - \sqrt{y}\]

\[x=  2 + \sqrt{y}\]

\[x= -2 + \sqrt{y}\]

Given \[x= -2 \pm \sqrt{y}\] and restricted domain is \[[-2, \infty)\] so \[x= -2 +\sqrt{y} \] will be the valid value of \(x\) because the negative values of the square root will lead to the values of the function which will be out of domain.

difficult

If \[x= a + \sqrt{y}\] then what is the value of y after interchanging the variables \[x\] and \[y\]?

\[y = -a + \sqrt{y}\]

\[y = -a + \sqrt{x}\]

\[y = a + \sqrt{y}\]

\[y = a + \sqrt{x}\]

\[y = a + \sqrt{x}\]

Given \[a + \sqrt{y}\] so after interchanging the variables \[x\] and \[y\] the resultant equation will be \[y = a + \sqrt{x}\].","[""https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.tutorpl.us/mathgpt/images/97/6d3d8816-a576-471e-9858-fa447f84e9b9.jpeg""]",Calculus Volume 1,Finding a Function’s Inverse,Inverse Functions,Functions and Graphs

In 1935, Charles Richter developed a scale (now known as the Richter scale) to measure the magnitude of an earthquake. The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude \(R_1\) on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude \(R_2\) on the Richter scale. Suppose \(R_1 > R_2\), which means the earthquake of magnitude \(R_1\) is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves. If \(A_1\) is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and \(A_2\) is the amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of the two earthquakes satisfy the following equation:

\[
R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right).
\]

Consider an earthquake that measures 8 on the Richter scale and an earthquake that measures 7 on the Richter scale. Then,

\[
8 - 7 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right).
\]

Therefore,

\[
\log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right) = 1,
\]

which implies \(A_1 / A_2 = 10\) or \(A_1 = 10A_2\). Since \(A_1\) is 10 times the size of \(A_2\), we say that the first earthquake is 10 times as intense as the second earthquake. On the other hand, if one earthquake measures 8 on the Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity of the two earthquakes satisfies the equation

\[
\log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right) = 8 - 6 = 2.
\]

Therefore, \(A_1 = 100A_2\). That is, the first earthquake is 100 times more intense than the second earthquake.

How can we use logarithmic functions to compare the relative severity of the magnitude 9 earthquake in Japan in 2011 with the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haiti in 2010?

To compare the Japan and Haiti earthquakes, we can use the relation between the amplitudes \[(A_1 \text{ and } A_2)\] and the magnitudes \[(R_1 \text{ and } R_2)\] of the two earthquakes, \[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\]. Substituting the given values of the magnitudes in the equation, we get

\[9 - 7.3 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right) .\]

What is the logarithmic equation that relates the magnitudes and amplitudes of two earthquakes?

\[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right)\]

\[R_1 + R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right)\]

\[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\]

The logarithmic equation that relates the magnitudes and amplitudes of two earthquakes is \[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\].

\[6 + 4 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\]

\[4 - 6 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\]

\[4 + 6 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\]

\[6 - 4 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\]

Using the logarithmic equation that relates the magnitudes and amplitudes of two earthquakes, the equation for these two earthquakes is \[6 - 4 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\].

difficult

If the amplitude of an earthquake is 6 and another earthquake has an amplitude of 4, what is the logarithmic equation that relates their magnitudes and amplitudes (where \[R_1 \text{ and } R_2\] are the magnitudes of the two earthquakes respectively)?

\[R_1 + R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{6}{4} \right)\]

\[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{6}{4} \right)\]

\[R_1 + R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)\]

\[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{6}{4} \right)\]

Using the logarithmic equation that relates the magnitudes \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) and the amplitudes \(6\) and \(4\) of two earthquakes, the relation is \[R_1 - R_2 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{6}{4} \right)\].

Using exponentiation to solve this expression for the ratio \[\frac{A_1}{A_2}\]

\[\frac{A_1}{A_2} = 10^{1.7}\approx 50\implies A_1\approx 50A_2.\]

If we put x=0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 in the function \[f(x)= \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}  \]. We would get 2.1, 2.01 and 2.001 respectively.

As we  read down each \[\frac{sin(x)}{x}\] column, we see that the values in each column appear to be approaching one. Thus, it is fairly reasonable to conclude that \[\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{sin(x)}{x} = 1.\]

A calculator or computer-generated graph of \[f(x) = \frac{sin(x)}{x}\] would be similar to that shown in Figure below, and it confirms our estimate.

\[\frac{\sqrt{b-0.001} + a}{b+0.001 }\]

\[\frac{\sqrt{b+0.001} - a}{0.001 }\]

From the table of functional values, we can infer that the value of the function \[\frac{\sqrt{x} - a}{x - b}\] when x is slightly more than b (say b+0.001) is \[\frac{\sqrt{b+0.001} - a}{0.001 }\].

In this case, the function has a vertical asymptote at \[x = 0\] because the denominator \[x^3\] becomes zero when \[x = 0\]. To confirm this, let's check the limit as \[x\] approaches 0:

\[ \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{1}{{x^3}} \]

When \[x\] approaches 0, \[\frac{1}{{x^3}}\] becomes unbounded. It approaches \[+\infty\] as \[x\] approaches 0 from the right, and \[-\infty\] as \[x\] approaches 0 from the left.

To show that every element in this set is in the range of \(f\), we need to show that for all \(y\) in this set, there exists a real number \(x\) in the domain such that \(f(x) = y\). Let \(y \geq 5\). Then, \(f(x) = y\) if and only if \[\sqrt{4-2x} + 5 = y.\]

Solving this equation for \(x\), we see that \(x\) must solve the equation
\[\sqrt{4-2x} = y - 5.\]
\(4-2x = (y - 5)^2.\)
\[x = -\frac{1}{2}(y-5)^2 + 2.\]

We just need to verify that \(x\) is in the domain of \(f\). Since the domain of \(f\) consists of all real numbers less than or equal to \(2\), and
\[-\frac{1}{2}(y-5)^2 + 2 \leq 2,\]

there does exist an \(x\) in the domain of \(f\). We conclude that the range of \(f\) is \(\{y | y \geq 5\}\).

1874_try_it_1,try_it,1874,"Find the domain and range for the function \[f(x) = \frac{5x + 2}{2x - 1}\]

First find domain of the function \[f(x) = \frac{5x +2}{2x -1}\]
You need to determine the values of \[x\] for which the denominator is not zero, so the domain is the set of values \[x\] such that \[2x -1 ≠ 0\] or \[2x ≠ 1\]. Therefore, the domain is \[{x|x ≠ \frac{1}{2}}\].

What is the domain of the function \[f(x) = \frac{3x - 5}{2x - 1}\]?

\[{x|x ≠ -\frac{1}{2}}\]

\[{x|x ≠ \frac{1}{2}}\]

\[{x|x ≠ -\frac{3}{5}}\]

\[{x|x ≠ \frac{5}{3}}\]

\[{x|x ≠ \frac{1}{2}}\]

The domain of the function \[f(x) = \frac{3x - 5}{2x - 1}\] is \[{x|x ≠ \frac{1}{2}}\] because the denominator cannot be zero.

What is the first step in finding the domain of a rational function?

Find the x-intercepts of the function

Set the function equal to zero

Set the denominator of the function equal to zero

Set the function greater than or equal to zero

Set the denominator of the function equal to zero

The first step in finding the domain of a rational function is to set the denominator of the function equal to zero. This is because the denominator of a function cannot be zero, as it would make the function undefined.

difficult

What is the domain of the function \[h(x) = \sqrt[n]{5 - x^2}\] where \[n\] is positive odd integer?

\[- \infty< x <\infty \]

\[0< x <\infty \]

\[\sqrt{5} \leq x \leq -\sqrt{5}\]

\[-\sqrt{5} \leq x \leq \sqrt{5}\]

\[- \infty< x <\infty \]

The domain of the function \[h(x) = \sqrt[n]{5 - x^2}\] is 
 \[- \infty< x <\infty \]. This is because the nth root of a number is defined for all real number if \[n\] is positive odd integer.

Range of the function \[f(x) = \frac{5x +2}{2x -1}\]
To find the range, we need to find the values \[y\] for which there exists a real number \[x\] such that

\[
y =\frac{5x +2}{2x -1}.
\]
When we multiply both sides of this equation by \[2x-1,\] we see that \[x\] must satisfy the equation

\[
2xy-y = 5x+2.
\]
Find value of \[x\]  in terms of y 
\[
2xy-5x =y+2.
\]

From this equation, we can see that \[x\] must satisfy

\[
x(2y - 5) = y +2.
\]
If \[y = \frac{5}{2},\] this equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as \[y ≠ \frac{5}{2},\]

\[
x = \frac{y + 2}{2y - 5}
\]

satisfies this equation. We can conclude that the range of \[f\] is \[{y | y ≠ \frac{5}{2}}\].

\((-\infty,\infty)\)

The range of the function \[f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x+2}\] is \((-\infty,\infty)\). This is because the cube root of a number is defined for all real values of \(x\) and \(2x+3\) can take all values from  \((-\infty,\infty)\), so range of the function \[f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x+2}\] will be \((-\infty,\infty)\).

Find the value of x from the function \[y= \frac{ax - b}{cx + d}\].Cross multiply \[cxy + dy = ax - b\] ,\[dy+b = ax-cxy\] and we get \[x= \frac{dy+b}{a - cy}\].

Let's use functional values to find the value of the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3}\) as \(x\) approaches \(0\) from the right (\(x \to 0^+\)).

\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3}\]

| \[x\] | \[f(x) \]| 
|---|---|
|\[-0.1 \] | \[\frac{1}{(-0.1)^3} = 1000 \]|

|\[-0.0001\]  |\[ \frac{1}{(-0.0001)^3} = 1000000000000\] |

As \(x\) approaches \(0\) from the right, it's evident that \(f(x)\) becomes extremely large (approaching infinity).

So, \(\lim_{{x \to 0^+}} \frac{1}{x^3} = \infty\). The function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3}\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\) from the right on the graph, indicating that the function values become unbounded as \(x\) approaches \(0\) from the right.

What is the limit of the function \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^n}\] as \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left (\[x \to 0^-\]) if \[n>1\]?

\[\infty\]

\[-\infty\]

\[\infty\] if \[n\] is even and \[-\infty\] if \[n\] is odd.

\[\infty\] if \[n\] is even and \[-\infty\] if \[n\] is odd.

Let's use functional value tables for both \[n\] as even and \[n\] as odd to find the limit of the function \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^n}\] as \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left (\[x \to 0^-\]).

When \[n\] is even:(Let's take \[n = 2\])

\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^n}\]

\[
\begin{align*}
x & \quad f(x) \\
-0.1 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.1)^2} = 100 \\
-0.01 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.01)^2} = 10000 \\
-0.001 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.001)^2} = 1000000 \\
-0.0001 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.0001)^2} = 100000000 \\
\end{align*}
\]

As \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left, it's evident that \[f(x)\] becomes extremely large (approaching infinity).

When \[n\] is odd: (Let's take \[n = 3\])
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{x^n}\]

\[
\begin{align*}
x & \quad f(x) \\
-0.1 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.1)^3} = -1000 \\
-0.01 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.01)^3} = -1000000 \\
-0.001 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.001)^3} = -1000000000 \\
-0.0001 & \quad \frac{1}{(-0.0001)^3} = -100000000000 \\
\end{align*}
\]

As \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left, it's evident that \[f(x)\] becomes extremely large in magnitude but with a negative sign (approaching negative infinity).

So,
- When \[n\] is even: \[\lim_{{x \to 0^-}} \frac{1}{x^n} = \infty\]
- When \[n\] is odd: \[\lim_{{x \to 0^-}} \frac{1}{x^n} = -\infty\]

As \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left, it's evident that \[f(x)\] becomes extremely large (approaching infinity).



As \[x\] gets closer to \[0\] from the left, the function values increase without bound, approaching infinity. Therefore, \[\lim_{{x \to 0^-}} \frac{1}{x^2} = \infty\].

To find the limit of the function \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\] as \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left (\[x \to 0^-\]), we can evaluate the expression by substituting values of \[x\] that are slightly less than \[0\]:

\[ \lim_{{x \to 0^-}} \frac{1}{x} \]

Let's consider the values as \[x\] approaches \[0\] from the left:

We then multiply out the numerator. We don’t multiply out the denominator because we are hoping that the \[(x-5)\] in the denominator cancels out in the end:


\[= \lim_{x \to 5} \frac{(\sqrt{x-1})^2+2\sqrt{x-1}-2\sqrt{x-1}-4}{(x-5)(\sqrt{x-1} + 2)}=\frac{x-5}{(x-5)(\sqrt{x-1} + 2)}.\]

\[(3 - \epsilon)^2 < x < (3 + \epsilon)^2\]
Subtracting 9 from both sides
\[(3 - \epsilon)^2 - 9 < x - 9 < (3 + \epsilon)^2 - 9\]

Unfortunately, our choice of \[\delta\] must depend on \[\epsilon\] only and no other variable. If we can replace \[\left|x + 1\right|\] by a numerical value, our problem can be resolved. This is the place where assuming \[\delta \leq 1\] comes into play. The choice of \[\delta \leq 1\] here is arbitrary. We could have just as easily used any other positive number. In some proofs, greater care in this choice may be necessary. Now, since \[\delta \leq 1\] and \[\left|x - 1\right| < \delta \leq 1\], we are able to show that \[\left|x + 1\right| < 3\]. Consequently, \[\left|x + 1\right| \cdot \left|x - 1\right| < \left|x - 1\right| \cdot 3\]. At this point we realize that we also need \[\delta \leq \frac{\epsilon}{3}\].

In the proof of a limit, why must our choice of \[\delta\] depend on \[\epsilon\] only and no other variable?

Because \[\epsilon\] represents the desired closeness to the limit

Because \[\epsilon\] represents the actual value of the limit

Because \[\epsilon\] represents the value of the function at the limit

Because \[\epsilon\] represents the difference between the function's value and the limit

Because \[\epsilon\] represents the desired closeness to the limit

In the proof of a limit, our choice of \[\delta\] must depend on \[\epsilon\] only because \[\epsilon\] represents the desired closeness to the limit.

Assume \[0 < \left|x - 1\right| < \delta\]. Thus,
\[\left|x - 1\right| < 1 \text{ and } \left|x - 1\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{3}\]
Since \[\left|x - 1\right| < 1\], we may conclude that \[-1 < x - 1 < 1\]. Thus, by adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we obtain \[1 < x + 1 < 3\]. Consequently, \[\left|x + 1\right| < 3\]. This gives us
\[\left|x^2 - 1\right| = \left|x - 1\right| \cdot \left|x + 1\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{3} \cdot 3 = \epsilon\]
