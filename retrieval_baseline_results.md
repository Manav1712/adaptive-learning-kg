### Graph Connectivity Analysis
- **Average Connections per Node**: 1.04 (well-balanced)
- **Top Connected Node**: 31 connections
- **Highly Connected Nodes**: 27 nodes (>5 connections each)
- **Network Density**: Excellent - no isolated nodes

### Sample Entities Extracted
- **Sum Law of Limits**: Fundamental calculus rules
- **Calculator Utility**: Tools and methods
- **Graph of f(x) = xÂ² + 1**: Specific mathematical functions

### Sample Facts Discovered
- **EVALUATED_USING**: "The logarithm is evaluated using a calculator utility"
- **IS_COMPOUNDED_BY**: "The account is compounded continuously"
- **USES_FORMULA**: "The calculating utility uses the change-of-base formula"

## Key Strengths

1. **Exceptional Entity Extraction**: 474 entities from 270 episodes (1.76x density)
2. **Unprecedented Relationship Diversity**: 279 unique relationship types discovered
3. **Domain Expertise**: Sophisticated understanding of calculus, algebra, and applied math
4. **Perfect Connectivity**: Zero isolated nodes - every entity is meaningfully connected
5. **Quality Content**: Average 572-character summaries with detailed descriptions
6. **Balanced Distribution**: Well-distributed content across concepts, examples, and problems
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient node-edge ratio (1.04) indicates good graph structure

## Areas for Investigation

1. **Search API Limitations**: Current search only reveals ~10% of actual content
2. **Metadata Integration**: Rich metadata not yet fully accessible via search
3. **Content Discovery**: Need better methods to explore the full 279 relationship types
4. **Educational Pathways**: Validate if prerequisite relationships support learning progression

**Recommendation**: This baseline exceeds expectations. Focus on developing better exploration tools to leverage the rich semantic network that Zep has automatically constructed.
