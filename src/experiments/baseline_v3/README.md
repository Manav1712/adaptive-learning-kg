# Baseline V3 Experiment Results

## Graph: `baseline_v3_ontology_enforced`

### Raw Graph Statistics
- **Total Nodes**: 845
- **Total Edges**: 1,694
- **Relationship Types**: 319

### Relationship Constraint Analysis
- **Total Relationships**: 1,694
- **Target Relationships**: 140 (PREREQUISITE_OF, PART_OF, ASSESSED_BY)
- **Noise Relationships**: 1,554
- **Constraint Effectiveness**: 8.3%

### Retrieval Performance (Rate/Search Limited)
- **derivative**: 5 nodes, 5 edges
- **limit**: 5 nodes, 5 edges  
- **integration**: 5 nodes, 5 edges
- **calculus**: 5 nodes, 5 edges
- **mathematics**: 5 nodes, 5 edges

## Key Findings

### Ontology Enforcement Results
- **Edge Type Reduction**: 319 types (vs 227 in V2, vs 169 in V1)
- **Constraint Effectiveness**: 8.3% (vs 8.4% in V2, vs baseline in V1)
- **Node Growth**: 845 nodes (vs 706 in V2, vs 474 in V1)

### Analysis
The ontology enforcement did not achieve the target goals:
- **Target**: 80%+ constraint effectiveness, <10 edge types
- **Actual**: 8.3% effectiveness, 319 edge types
- **Result**: Ontology enforcement failed to constrain edge formation as intended

### Production Readiness Assessment
❌ **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**
- Edge type noise is still extremely high (319 types)
- Constraint effectiveness remains low (8.3%)
- Ontology enforcement did not work as expected

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why `set_ontology()` method failed to constrain edges
2. Consider alternative approaches for relationship constraints
3. Evaluate if Zep's ontology enforcement has fundamental limitations
4. May need to move to offline edge generation approach as outlined in coach.md

## Experiment Configuration
- **Graph ID**: baseline_v3_ontology_enforced
- **Episodes**: 270 (same as V2)
- **Ontology**: Custom entity types (Concept, Example, Exercise, TryIt)
- **Edge Constraints**: PREREQUISITE_OF, PART_OF, ASSESSED_BY with source/target restrictions
- **Fact Rating**: Applied instruction for relationship relevance
- **Type Balancing**: 250 max per type enabled
